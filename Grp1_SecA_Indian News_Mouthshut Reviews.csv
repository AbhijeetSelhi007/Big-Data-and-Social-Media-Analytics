Channel,Title,Rating,Review
Aajtak,Highlight more negative type of news,1,In the morning time they show a continuous series of short news stories. 70% of them are all crimes of higher severity. Obviously morning time pushing all negativity is not at all good idea. I propose they cover negative news later some time.
Aajtak,Boycott aaj tak,1,Lot of fake /incorrect news has been aired by this channel. This is not a new channel rather an agent of some political party.  Boycott this news channel.
Aajtak,WORST NEWS CHANNEL AAJ TAK INDIA TODAY,1,WORST AND NON-RELIABLE NEWS CHANNEL OF INDIA. 99% NEWS ARE FABRICATED. THIS CHANNEL BROADCASTED FAKE NEWS.

Channel android app is good it shows live tv so you can watch live tv channel right on your phone anywhere no need to switch tv on The channel  app also provide other features like  news videos , offline reading , sharing of news, view photos , bookmark news, personalised notification. Also the channel entertains by its short ironical so sorry episodes which I like very much Cons - No audio only news , you have to watch videos for news App is little bit buggy as it stops sometimes automatically The channel shows less news more advertisement Also in app live channel is not available in HD quality No popup player available for live tv channel in app so that one can do other work also while listening news Overall its a very good channel for news to follow & app is also ok. So I will give 4/5 stars from my side to channel app."
Aajtak,Very good application for watching news,5,AajTak is an excellent android mobile application for watching news. I always use to watch news over here. Here you get most relevant news about any matter very instantly as it happens. In this application you can go through all the programs and actions of AajTak whenever you want. On watching news over here I feel like watching actual TV. The video  quality displayed by this application is also of very good quality.
Aajtak,Deliver the goods !,4,Hello guys! We have lot of news channels in our set top box but aaj tak is one of best news channel . aaj tak  is always gave real news . aaj tak is always deliver fast news update than other news channels . They are first investigate what is the real story about incident and than they are broadcast the news. They always update you. They are always beware you from fake news and update you with the real one. Their express news is very useful for us.
Aajtak,"Show news guys, not drama!",1,"Media is one of the strongest medium. They are very powerful and one of their prime goal should be to serve news. Aaj Tak is one of the most dramatized news channel you could ever find. They have went from showing news to manipulating and adding MASALA to sell their news. I mean look at the news titles they make these days. It feels really annoying to watch Aaj tak or let alone sitting with someone watching aaj tak. If the don't have news they make up some news. I think they should learn from the news anchors and reporters of channels like Al Jazeera, CNN etc to how to show news. Wake Up, the coun"
Aajtak,"Creating a ""DRAMA"" in every story!",1,"We live in a world where what we see with our eyes on the television is the truth, without checking facts. ""Jo dikhta hai, wo bikta hai"" Basically, the reporters need to sensationalise every story to prove their point. This news channel tops the list of all that drama they try to sell us. They literally create a story of ""how things happened"" to sometimes create fictional characters to justify the truth. I fail to understand why do we need to sensationalise everything. These are ""real"" happenings, not some story from a chitrakatha! To cover the story of a murder, they initially sensationalise it, then further interview the maximum number of people around the murder house, including the innocent dog that was on the street the night of murder! Gosh! The anchors of the afternoon shows literally rake up old flames of bollywood and give new twists and turns to create stories. The old flames are now grandfathers and grandmothers, why do you want to create problems in families for TRPs! Not to talk about the crores of Ads that further kill the joy of listening to the latest happenings. Gone are the days when Doordarshan used to have a simple reporter in traditional Indian attire, who used to give the News in a simple straightforward language. If reporting demise of some politician, a drop of voice was used or to give a happy news, it was related with a smile on the face. Aajtak totally relies on ""creating"" a story rather than going into the facts and ""covering"" the story in an apt way. I hate the way the reporters create stories of small thing that happens arpund an accident, death or wedding! Last Word: This News channel is not my cup of tea! Totally Not Recommending!"
Aajtak,Best news channel ever,3,"Aaj tak is the India leading news channel, It is watch by the every one.This channel leads the other news channel  how to the news represent to the audience. Aaj.Aaj tak is India number news channel last 10 years.Today aaj tak provides a mobile software so using this we can access the news by anywhere.They provides the news very fast and news based on the truth.this is a very interesting part of the news channel.

The app as well as news channel is TRP concerned, only political news and cricket news are shown with great interest. In the app we can read political and commercial blogs. *"
Aajtak,One of the most popular news channels in India,5,"One of the most popular news channels in India: Aajtak is a 24 hours hindi news channel which was launched in 1998 and has continued to keep us up-to-date with their live telecasts. Their reporters speak well, are straightforward and not biased towards anybody. They have segments such as ‘nonstop 100’ wherein they show you 100 news without a break, ‘khabrein superfast’ which shows news in an express manner and ’10 minute main 50 khabrein’ which shows 50 top news in just 10 minutes. Their show ‘Adhbhut Akalpaniya’ talks about people from various walks of life and their journey is super inspiring, and in ‘Uparwala dekh raha hai’ we see the hosts discussing social issues with experts that shows us the ground reality. Although I preferred Aaj tak only for watching news but of late I have noticed that it shows a lot of advertisements every few minutes thus I have no choice but to watch another channel!"
Aajtak,Best of breaking news provider,4,Aaj Tak is best news provider in the india and I think so it the best platform to gain knowledge about the latest upcoming news in market. Aaj Tak is provider  important news weather news and other news so I'd like onli to channels to watch news The Times of India and aajtak. the best news provider in India it's a competitive is there any news channel and also been so many words to provide a good news in market so I recommend to all of you to watch the this  because I was there is a  news channels which provide you through news and also provide any information news life science technology and  horoscope so you must watch  your daily news.

Aajtak,Baseless NEWS coverage -Ruins existing image,1,"Really disheartening on Aaj tak news coverage supporting negativity. In Past we just rely on the aaj tak coverage only, now the channel loose its confidence from majority of people in  society. Nowdays Aaj Tak NEWS authenticity is having big question mark . Sushant and Hathras case reporting by Aaj tak coverage shows negative coverage and supporting culprits . Need to Re-asses their performance and need to seek their past performance in order to comeback else it would be difficult ."
Aajtak,Rajdeep is Lisburn for Chanel,1,"Rajdeep sardesai is funny guy , he always like tI tease a person while conducting interviews. So many Time he was shamelessly insulted . AajTak was best channel and can be a good Chanel without Rajdeep. I have doubt about his capability to work in a news channel. His father was great cricketer and he is known more because of his father name  than his own capabilities. Aaj tak should take note of it."

Aajtak,Only for TRP. ??????,1,Only for TRP. You are giving space to culprits. Whatâ€™s the need to show such a worst telecast of that culprit.
Aajtak,Trust broken,1,Giving forum to culprit not expected from respected channel.. public and channel don't stand on same ground.
Aajtak,Worst channel,1,"They are giving a chance to culprit who is drug dealer, who is wahiyaat. Even in the interview she is lying that SSR afraid from flying but this is lie go and check ankita lokhande video. I don't understand what you guys thought of taking this suck's interview. She is doing black magic. I loved your channel but In this SSR case you're baised, you're also doing competition with Republic Bharat. If she have guts and if she is saying truth she can come to Republic media then will see what's gonna she say. As pithani got flumbed over the interview I'm granting she won't be able to say even a single word on Republic media but you guys took her interview at mid night that doesn't mean that she is right. I really wish that as early as CBI needs to arrest that black magic girl."
Aajtak,Best news anchor,5,"Syed Ansari is best announcer in my opinion.he speaks each word clearly and neatly, in my opinion he is number one anchor."
Aajtak,Worst Channel,1,Totally worst channel. These people try to improve the image of CULPRITS. We as common people can something but they cannot see anything. Previously I thought they were genuine but now I know their reality. After seeing them desperately trying to improve the image of Rhea Chakraborty on their channel. The proof they have is the chat between Rhea and his old boyfriend cum dad Mahesh Bhatt. I didn't saw the chat on other channels. Why were they so much favoured by Rhea and Shiv sena on such a wonderful chat material. Please don't spoil the image of media in front of us all by supporting wrong people. I am going to cut them off my Dish plan such that I or my family member accidentally land on the channel. Go to hell guys!
Aajtak,Biased Channel,1,"This is another channel people are subscribing overseas and what you see people are deceived by giving them false news about The Indian Government. All news in this channel  are biased in showing how great the present government is doing. The anchors are asking questions to the opposition parties instead of asking to the ruling party. What a shame. They are not asking the govt. about the economy the gdp growth, jobs, price hikes, which the present govt. is responsible. And these questions are asked to the opposition parties why they are not able to do this for the people. The PM of the country has been projected as a ruler of the country and India cannot do anything  without his consent. Pathetic state of affairs in India. And Dish TV and others are selling these channels of fake. My request would be for all those Indians who love My country to unsubscribe these Godi Channels and fight against the government. God bless India. Jaihind."
Aajtak,Godi media,1,Targeting one religious not relevant anything jus targeting people's unwanted issues. Be Indian see going on around you.
Aajtak,Show only motivated things,3,Aaj Tak channel is good but show only motivated things Today ur channel is showing rubbish things like rates in China have done soo much injuries in 14 th centuryMany people's have diedand many were injured andall thatAt this time people are already scarred so don't show this types of things

Aajtak,Aaj Tak News !!,3,"There are hundreds of mobile application available in android market for news. Aaj Tak is one of the good Hindi news application provided by Aaj Tak TV Channel. I have downloaded this application recommended by Aaj Tak Channel. I am using this application from last some month and happy with result given by it. I must describe some good and worst aspects of this application. Its my true experience and sharing here. Good Aspects 1 This is free application which provide latest hindi news on mobile with just fingertip. 2 Aaj Tak provide us latest news with many categories like political news, world news, local news and current affairs. 3 Aaj Tak provide us some news with videos and we can watch video news also in this application. 4 This application allow us to share latest news with friends via social medias like Facebook and Twitter as well on Whatsapp. 5 This application provide news in hindi font and if our mobile does not support Hindi text, we can still read Hindi text in it. Worst Aspects 1 This application contains lot of advertisements and I do not like it, it have really many advertisement in it. 2 This application is slower in even 3G network, I have not used it in 2G network, if slow in 3G than you can understand what will happen in 2G networks. Conclusion I am using this application and just for advertisement issues, I am not happy with it. Aaj Tak must improve in application for make it more useful for us. You can download and try this application."
Aajtak,Fake news channel Aaj Tak,1,"Aaj tak is a fake news channel. Never I will see this channel, how a owner of a news channel can support a accused, a drug peddler. I have really a big doubt and seeing a big racket behind that. I support Republic Bharat and republic tv. Aaj tak is fake news channel cleared to me when I saw Rajdeep Desai was asking premeditated question and answer. Very sorry for Aaj tak channel it's real face came out in public."
Aajtak,Pathetic News Channel & their Anchor,1,"I was one of the regular viewer of ajtak but now I switched to republic Bharat and times now. Ajtak is showing wrong news every time without doing their homework. And the headline they are putting is worst, which actually not matched to the news. No sense of Journalism. They are loosing their credibility."
Aajtak,AAj Tak is rediculous channel,1,Very sad to see Rhea interview @ Aaj Tak. Shame on you Rajdeep and Aaj Tak. Aaj Tak must be banned and there must be action  taken against Aaj Tak.
Aajtak,Worst Media Channel,1,"Its name should be ""Criminal Tak"" because it supports prime accused person i.e. Rhea Chakraborty and other dumb bollywood heroes, I have already cancelled the subscription of this fake news channel. Note - please have 0 star option included in ""Star Rating"""
Aajtak,Only masala news here,2,"Aaj tak channel coverage of political news I must say is very fast and absolute. Though I hate these guys because of the they have commercialized everything but audience watch it.after all it's all about TRPs. They are ver fast in covering the news.but very loud. They have this perception imposition on news.and most of their anchors act arrogantly and behave like they are the supermen. But, I could see a lot of biased news lot of times.During election period keep an eye on this channel's programs.you will understand what I am saying.as u can see all the time  Unethical journalism is ethical and cool here on this channel. But, this is total masala news channel.i hate most when they telecast superstitious programs like tarot card readers, some babajis telling you future etv.This guys even do not mind to sell some superstitious products through their channel.i do not understand despite they must be earning so much of money still why they go for loud and stupid programs which mislead the country. They are definitely number 1 but I hate them. Half the time they play commercials only. Thanks for reading my review and rate my review useful or very useful. Don't forget to follow me for latest updates."

Aajtak,No 1 news channel,4,"Today I want to review aaj tak. When I have get enough time to watch tv. I always preferred to watch news . As it helps to aware me that what going happening in world but there is lot of news channel but aaj tak is amazing and best among them As we know that it is no 1 Hindi news channel among various channel for last 19 years.as it gets numerous awards for being no 1. One thing I don't like about this channel is that it show unnecessary ads during breaking news suppose it their half an hour events they show 10 minutes news and 20 minutes displaying ads.otherwise whether its anchors, its way to show the news tremendous, its application just one word brilliant. They showing various  show which covers news all-round the world whether it politics, business, sports, entertainment etc.SHATAK AAJ TAK, VAARDAAT, SO SORRY is my favourite.i never miss them. Punya parsoon joshi and rahul kawal is my favourite anchors.They way they interviewed the celebrities, politician, crickters brilliant.I like the interview when rahul kanwal interview cm yogi what type of genuine question he asked.my mother and sister is also love aaj tak channel. they like the show saas bahu aur betiyan. Aaj tak application is very good as it I get all notification regarding breaking news, video option is available in menu option, notification regarding upcoming goverment jobs, health, beauties, bussiness ideas, share market news, layout and features is very attractive.wonderful news channel aaj tak."
Aajtak,Best Application For Breaking News,4,"Today, I am going to give review of reputed for breaking news that is known as'AajTak'. I have been using this application since 2015. This app has many attractive features. First of all, I can watch the live stream of AajTaj TV. I do not worry if I missed my favorite show because I can also view the TV shows which has already broadcasted. I can watch news videos, discussions and analysis from AajTaj journos like Anjana Om Kashyap, Sweta Singh and many more. Furthermore, I can watch photos of my favorite sport stars and politicians from the exclusive photogallery. I can set the notification to get alerts of breaking news. Interestingly, I can switch to offline mode so I can read all the news with Internet. Lastly, I can share news articles, photos, videos via Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc. I love this application because this app is faster, and easy to browse. Thanks a lot."
Aajtak,Looks like BJP news Channel,2,"Comes under largest news channel in India but looks like a BJP  channel, I am also a BJP supporter but not like this. This news channel only shows what bjp do, what yogi do in up and all about bjp. These aaj tak team even don't think about the other news of the whole country. They only focus on old concept to gaining TRP. It shows that features and functions are hopeless for any common man. I never refer to anyone for being live update with Aaj Tak News Channel."
Aajtak,Aaj tak news,1,It is the worst news channel.it is not a good channel .this has its attitude to the recent government.this shows which news for the government call.many time it repeat the same news and perticular person on news. And it show only paid news .it takes a big amount of money from perticulars and shows related that news many times.for example this times around one minth it shows only up cm yogi news.and it does not tell about other news in idia there is other state present besides the up but it show only yogi yogi news.i am not the critics of yogi.i am also support him .because he are doing most efforts than othes and doing much better up than previous.but only one type of news repeat and repeat irritate my self .channel also should show other state news.and work with freedom.
Aajtak,Aai tak channel app,3,"Hello friends . aaj tak channels is very useful for user . this channels app have a specific design for user, this channels app based for news and breaking news live show, headline, top news . so many things, aaj tak channels is very good channels for news collection and also up date with society .this channels app is well layout and functioning ability . this app consumer less ram of android . it is very small app .this app is user friendly and very useful"
Aajtak,Trusted News,5,Aaj Tak News channel is very very good channel.I think much people of India are seeing this News channel now a days. When I get up in the morning first of all I see this channel because it sees a good and interesting  news. Concept is very good. Much people are see this channel at a time we can say there is big crowd at a time.Media's member of Aaj Tak news are much they help it very much for searching news. This is very useful channel as I think my all family like it very much so friends please watch this channel and see truly what happening in our country. Thank You
Aajtak,Draamebaaj of T.V,2,"Media is strong content. In every Nation media plays a very important role to make country strong, and shows the original news or truth. Aaj tak Channel is the leading Channel in india and also popular but just for name,  they create draama of every story or news. They shows advertisement more than the news. They have no fix time for special news like sports, politics, general knowledge. In sports news they shows only on Cricket news or debate on Cricket. They don't promte other games like hockey. Designing and layout of the channel is good you can say that body is beautiful but heart is black. This channel is less useful for students as they don't show any general knowledge. Less use for ladies they don't give any tips for home use as per conclusion it is less useful. Thanks."
Aajtak,"Propaganda news channel, Aaj tak!",1,"Aaj tak has been popular news channel since many years but it's running nothing but propaganda news these days! Anchors like Anjana Om Kashyap, Sweta Singh show news in favor of Modi and BJP! Their shows like Agenda have audience who are pro-BJP! They have no credibility anymore! Skip this news channel if you want to escape propaganda journalism!"
Aajtak,Voice of india.,4,"Aaj tak is best known new channel in india. It is famous among the indian masses.I personally watch this channel from last 13 years. This channel won many prestigious awards and best channel from last few consecutive years. In conclusion, this channel is good in all respect and update you around the clock."
Aajtak,In this channel news is less and ad is more,2,"As this is the leading news channel of india but they are not deserving for this title. When I saw this channel in the morning they saw 1 min news and 10 min ad and this is very irritating. The news is dramatic and worthless. So guys please ignore this channel and watch another channels like ABP NEWS, INDIA NEWS etc."
Aajtak,More drama less news,2,"Aaj tak is one of the leading news channel in India . but on this channel  news is presented as drama or any type of stories with lots of add ups to increase on their ratings . there are many shows on this channel which are irrelevant in terms of news  most of the time a single big story hides all other news whole day a single story runs sometimes . lots of drama occurs on the channel . they transform the news in drama. some news are overemphasized by the channel and some are lees shown . Half of the time in a day only advertisements are running there are only few good night shows on the channel and rest of the more advertisement and less news .and there is not fix time for different segments of news . like sports, foreign news etc . sports news mainly concerned with cricket and before and after any match cricket news or debate is there .there is no daily sports segment. people like the channel for all drama and there way of showing news.but one should defiantly found that areal touch is missing ."
Aajtak,Aaj tak best,4,Whenever I want to watch the news I will go with aaj tak news channel because this is a very trusted news channel and I trust this channel so much because they show the right news to their viewers .the most strongest point of this news channel that the update of this news channel is so fast and they present the breaking news so fast .i am a big fan of cricket and whenever I want to watch a cricket report I go with aaj tak

IndiaToday,Fake news spreaded,1,I don't like lost faith in your journalism paid news channel. Rajdeep dessai spreaded fake news about Sushant and defaming family is disturbing. Trying to cover up drug cartel in bollywood. Rhea is responsible for her action and maha govt dictatorship behaviour has lost public faith now.
IndiaToday,Worst experience ever,1,I took yearly subscription of India Today and after repeated chasers I finally asked them to refund my money. But neither I got the subscription nor my money. This is the most pathetic magazine/newspaper company who is looting their own customers. Never subscribe or make prepaid payments to them.
IndiaToday,Mirror of Corporate and Rich Peoples,3,"Now time has gone but some media publication group is still not serious about contents. Yes I am talking about India today. This magazine may be top and leading magazine of our Nation but on the matter of content India Today is just time pass. Some times I feel thay this magazine has no strong and social issues, no social responsibility. This Magazine has been making strong Mirror of Corporate and Rich Peoples for last decade. Yes Readers has been reading only socalled acadimic knowledge of instutions, new sex survey and personalities of Richhest men of india. This old reputated magazine has become Agent of Powerful and Royal Class. This publication has been printing many magazines only for advertisements. India today has no breaking Story right now. Editor please foregive me but you know the naked reality of India Today. Please go to commom people."
IndiaToday,Another political mouthpiece,1,Been reading India today for more than a decade now. Stopped autorenewal of online subscription after realising it is now no more the unbiased magazine it used to be. When series of editions look like a mouthpiece for leftist ideology I had to stop reading like it was the case with Outlook and front line.Only regret is this magazine also may end up like the above two magazines to the leftist fringe out of the mainstream.
IndiaToday,India Today Group Magazine Subscription,1,"I had purchased 2 subscriptions from the India Today group - Auto Bild and Money Today (Subscription IDs AUTO1666857 & MONTD1943309). However, in May/Jun 2015, India Today abruptly stopped the puRobotouchcation of both. There was no prior information or even after the fact. Obviously, I asked for a refund on my balance payment. This is when things really started going downhill. From May 2015 till now, I have written countless mails to Wecarebg@intoday.com (which actually should be We_Donotcare_bg@intoday.com) and called the helpline several times. Everytime, the service reps either gave a false date on which the cheques would be dispatched or some excuse for missing the promised date. I always thought India Today Group was a very professional company given the quality of their puRobotouchcations but I was seriously disappointed after this close encounter. It is clear that they have no respect for the customers, but only for their money. Now that they have to release my money, apparently they are complicating the situation purposefully to force me to give up. I sincerely request India Today Top management to display professional behaviour and refund my long-pending money from both subscriptions immediately."
IndiaToday,Read history instead of news.,1,I am a subscriber to India Today for a long time and their service has become absolutely third rate during the past 1 year. I am based in Chennai and almost for a year now 2 or 3 issues of India Today get bunched together and delivered in one lot. I do not know who has the time or patience to read all these issues together and by the time the magazine is delivered most of the news has become stale. I personally went to their Office in Anna Salai and showed them the unopened envelope containing 4 issues. I met a person called Bala who is supposed to be in charge of subscription. He promised that they would ensure timely delivery in future and after a few months again for the past 2 months I am getting 2 to 3 issues delivered together. For some strange reason they have not listed their phone number in their website and you have to personally go to their office for lodging a complaint. I called their customer care number and had to speak to a lady and she kept asking some stupid and irrelevant questions and refused to provide their Chennai Office number. I had again gone to their office and met Bala and informed him that I do not want any future issues of India Today being delivered to me. There was not even an apology from India Today and this shows the character of the organization and its people. If you are thinking of taking subscription for India today drop the idea. There are better magazines around which get delivered on time.
IndiaToday,India's Worst Magazine Subscription Service,1,"India Today, India's Worst Magazine Subscription Service. Despite being a member and reviewer on this site, I did not bother to check the reviews of India Today before I foolhardily decided to subscribe its English edition in 2014. Below is a letter I sent to We Care in Aug, 2015. To, India Today Customer Care, WE CARE, The India Today Group, A-61 Sector 57, Noida(UP) – 201301. Subject: Subscription Number ITEXXXXXXX. This is regarding my Case Id 3634554 for Subscription Number ITEXXXXXX. I subscribed for India Today English Ed under Order No. ITE-WEB-140904-216584. My subscription did not start until Oct 20th, that too after my first email to you dated Oct 16, 2015. My subscription was to run from issues dated 20/10/2014  to 12/10/2015. The Mar 16 issue was the last ever issue I received. Several issues before that had either been delivered late or not at all. I had requested, via Case Id 3634554, for cancellation of my subscription with immediate effect.  Also refer to Case ID 3643633 and Case Id 3648937. Kindly refer to all my email correspondence to you. I had not received a single issue after the issue dated March 16. Now after a gap of 5 months you have suddenly restarted delivering issues, with the issue of Aug 17, sent via India Post. Despite my several requests you have not officially cancelled my subscription. Please cancel my Subscription Number ITE1955513, with effect from March 16, 2015 and arrange for refund of my balance payment. If you do not wish to return my money, do not do so, at least do not insult me by resuming delivery after a gap of 5 months. If you do decide to return my balance amount, kindly let me know. I have enclosed India Today Issue Aug 17, 2015 with this letter. An extremely unhappy customer, Name, Address. Dated: Aug 22, 2015. Copies of this letter to; Aroon Purie, Editor-in –Chief. Manoj Sharma, Group Business Head. Ashish Bagga, Group CEO. - There has been no response from We Care. Instead they are now sending 1 issue by post every third week. I was foolish in not heeding to reviews on Mouthshut and now I have paid for it."
IndiaToday,Good to read,5,"I have been avid reader of India Today for at least 19 years now. And believe me it was worth every letter that I read. I have done all my education in Marathi medium and was worried about my English, when I entered Engineering College. Due to my interest in current affairs, I started reading India Today. Whatever level I have achieved in English, a great extent is due to India Today. Contents and Coverage It is beyond doubt that India Today covers India like no one does. All the states are covered through a network of correspondents. The co-ordination of these correspondents with editorial staff in HQ and in the inputs from research really makes the stories worth reading. Even the cartoons of Ajit Ninan have always been scoring hits on the bull! Editors India Today has had number of editors but they have been very consistent. I think they have managed to establish a tradition, a system, a n institution, whereby exit of a editor does not affect overall editorial effort. That is a great sign. Stories Whenever India Today has covered a story it has been multidimensional coverage. Statistics, investigations, comments of ALL sides, interviews . all add up to an excellent feature stories. Impartiality I think this has been the major hallmark of India Today and certainly the major reason why I still read it even today. In the days when every magazine, newspaper worth its name is having their axes to grind, India Today has tried to be very impartial. You can find Mani Shankar Aiyer, Tavleen Singh expressing two diametrically opposite views. on facing pages! and I sincerely feel that.IT HAPPENS ONLY IN INDIA(Today). Language While keeping the use of English relatively simple, India Today has helped me in building good library of phrases for my use. I consider the beginning and ends of every story or news item in India Today as a lesson in good reporting. Most heartening thing for me is the fact that India Today group has managed to pass on MOST of these qualities to its new sibling Aaj Tak. Impartial, high quality, quick & fast, responsible. I wish they start similar channel in English!"
IndiaToday,Dont even think to subscribe india today,1,"I subscribed the English India Today - one year package. I paid the full amount online. I did not get any issue for continuous two months. Then I applied for the cancellation in around April 2014. Till date the money has not been refunded. They totally ""fraud"" with their customers. So, never go for subscribing India Today magazines."
IndiaToday,India Today magazine is cheating the people,1,"Please, please dont be cheated. Please do not subscribe for India today Magazine. They attract the customers and get them subscribed with false advertisements, false promises. Once the money gets credited to their account, they dont bother whether customer is receiving his copy or not.  when we query, they write apologies emails many times, however no action will be taken. as per thier emails they say 8 business days for looking into the issue, however it takes 8 months also. in the interim you will not recive your copies and no refund will be given to you. they are official  robbers and cheaters. I have written almost 10 times to look into my prompt delivery of the magazines. however I received 3 week copies out of 24 weeks."
IndiaToday,My all mails to IndiaToday and their fake replies,1,Guys please visit below link where I have posted my almost all the historic mail requests to IndiaToday for the non-receipt of the subscriptions and their fake commitments from November 2013 to May 2014: http://psrawat2014.blogspot.in/2014/08/here-are-my-repetitive-mails-to.html Hope this will help you decide why you should never ever go for the subscription of this magazine and lose your hard-earned money.

IndiaToday,Please Don't Subscribe To This Magazine,1,"I had subscribed to this magazine for a year. In the initial one and a half month I didn't get any copy from India Today where they promise customers that they will have it within one month. I then started calling & mailing the customer care and then luckily after a couple of weeks I got a call from my local vendor of India Today that I will now get the copies on time. I felt nice and thought that at least now I will start getting my copies on time. Vendor gave me my first issue and then next time again I waited for my vendor to deliver me the copies. I then called him many times and then he delivered me the next issue. It has been 2 months and now it has become a routine that I make call my vendor and request him to send the copies which he never does on time and sometimes he skips my issues. I had sent a mail to customer care also, in this regard but didn't get any answer from them. Now I am really tired of calling that bas@#$% vendor and this shitty customer care of IndiaToday. I just want to request the readers that don't get trapped in the subscription of India Today. If you really want to have this magazine then buy it from your local shop and be happy. One more request to the readers - still if you subscribe and find my story true then please please write a review to various websites and let people know about this bogus India Today Group. Best Rgds, Deepak"
IndiaToday,Open letter to India Today Group.,1,"Below is an actual complaint email I sent to their business group head today, with all proof of my previous communication. Sharing with wider audience so as to highlight how risky their online payment portal is your money gets debited but they seem to have no resource to confirm receipt) and absolutely unreliable, unprofessional customer care service. Hi Mr. Manoj Sharma, Considering you are the group business head, could you please let me know whom should I contact at your organisation learntoday.in for information on my course materials which has not been provided ever since I made payment of Rs.4950 via netbanking on Jan 29, 2014? As per the FAQ on learntoday.in, I'm supposed to get the materials instantly if payment is done via netbanking but nothing has been done so far. My bank is ICICI and they have confirmed that the payment successfully went through and I have provided the proof to your Learn today staff at info@learntoday.in and help@learntoday.in. You can see all this in the trail emails below. However I have not received any update on what's happening - if the course will be provided or the money refunded. I sent 10 emails as you can see, messages on learn today Facebook page, even sent a courier to your office(addressing you) and still no reply. What does this kind of service say about your group? I am requesting you to let me know whom else to contact as nobody in info@learntoday.in and help@learntoday.in replies. Their website has no contact number or physical address. I can't believe they are a part of your group. I called your Wecare team twice at 0120 2479900. Both the times, the staff had no clue about what they were saying .They kept giving me the contact number of your separate organisation U Learn Today(ulearntoday.com), and not learntoday.in. See my email below to ulearntoday team who informed me that they have nothing to do with learntoday.in. Can you see how confusing and frustrating this entire episode is? Whatever impression I have had about India today group from the last few decades is now quite shattered. I would highly appreciate if atleast you could be courteous enough to reply to my email, a positive one hopefully! User id in learntoday.in - xxxxxxxx@gmail.com Thanks Manoj NOTE to MS readers - Kindly avoid making online payments on any of India today associated websites due to the above mentioned risk of your money being debited and they either not confirming receipt of payment or just not communicating to you at all on WTH's happening! Update today, 27 Mar, 2014 - I have marked another 24 heads of India Today in my 14th email today, requesting an update on what's happening. I will send email to all these people every day till I get some answer, somewhere from someone! Update one hour later, 27 Mar 2014 - Atlast! I think marking everybody & anybody in India today worked. I got a call from their team, and given link to my course successfully, with the usual apologies & stuff. Do I still recommend learntoday or for that matter, India today? At the moment, I'd say take your call. I'd a bad experience and hope no one else goes through this nightmare."
IndiaToday,Don't Waste Your Money on India Today Subscription,1,Subscribed to the Cosmopolitan and made the biggest mistake of my life. Totally fed up of following up every month because I don't receive my copy. Their customer support is equally bad. Take my word and pick up a copy from newsstands if you need one! I consider that I have lost my money and don't own a subscription at all instead of following up. The standard feedback is that we will add another month to your subscription as we have ran out of copies. They will also ask you to wait till the end of the month for the subscription of the current month.
IndiaToday,India today must fire WECARE team.,1,"My subscription No ITE1917662 . I made online payment on 12 Sept 2011. And recieved my first copy in Nov 2011 end that too after constant reminders mails. 1.And Voila they say that my subscription has started from 17 Oct 2011 ( where are the copies) then after few more mail reminders -these loosers send me old copies .(In december what will I do with Oct 17 issue???) 2.I specified the size I want ( Large ) they send me Medium sized T-Shirts and now want me to send that back to them 3.I recieved one copy and then no further copy I wrote to them to cancel my subscription 3 times - everytime I get the standard ""We sincerely regret the inconvenience caused to you. We do understand you have every reason to be vexed with us. We would like to assure you that such a lapse will not recur and we hope we shall be able to redeem ourselves in the future and will continue to have you as one of our satisfied subscriber. We also request you for your kind understanding and co-operation"" Phew I don't know when they will cancel my subscription & refund my hard-earned money. Advice : Don't subscribe -contrary to what they advertise you don't save anything. 1.You wont get the promised presents. 2.You won't get the issues . 3.If on rare occasion you do get than they will never be on time. 4.Drag your feet & buy it from the newsstand or better still read Weekly or Outlook. Hope some one reads this & take action"
IndiaToday,Very Poor subscription Service,1,"While the magazine is good , it might be only magazine reflecting India's sentiments. Journalism is good. Subscription services are worst. They are cheating people. I subscribed 3 months ago. I got only 3 magazine out of 12. I was supposed to get. I wrote 8 mails to them , but none got answered. There is no escalation mechanism, so you rely bunch of under performers at wecare I think it is better to buy the magazine on stands than subscription. Regards Avneesh."
IndiaToday,Not to believe on online products,1,"I was trying to place order on Internet for purchase of Reebok Shoes & other stuff, but stop in between and received called from India Today. Push ne for make payment on phone, So I did it through my Credit Card. Expeceted delievery within 15-20 days, but not received the products, So complaint to India Today & my credit card company. Credit Card company reveresed the payment but til today after 6 month, claim is not settle between Credit Card company & India Today. So dare to buy anything from India Today."
IndiaToday,The place of getting looted,1,"India today, one of the biggest cheater on this earth..They gives unnecessary shows for subscribing to magazines.and then later on once we make the payment, neither I received the Copy nor I received the gift.. Good for nothing..This company is just making fool of people by sending them mails on daily basis. I request to all of you to avoid such scams..its more than 5 months that I have paid for there subscription , but since the day I made the payment, they just forgot me. I never received any call or msg from them. And also not received any kind of welcome letter or information of getting subscribed other than mail.. Why they promise to deliver when they cant Govt of india should ban such co."
IndiaToday,Subscription gift good for dustbin,3,I subscribed for the India today and got a Mobile phone as a subscription gift which is good for dust bin only.Why good magazine like India Tody ploy ths kind of cheap gimmick to lure customer.Rather they should have increased the number of years of subscription as an alternative of increase the discount. The price of the gift they mention in the ad.is no where near to actual. It is unknown Chinese useless item not worth using
IndiaToday,Bad delivery system,1,1) mumbai contact phone number published in the mag does not exist for the last six months yet it is published week after week. 2)toll free number always busy. 3)STD call from mumbai to noida centre cost more than the missed mag due to extensive verification details and call on hold 4)finally if you are able to register a complaint ther is no follow up. 5)they have our email id only to try and sell products to us but no tome to ack our complaint. 6)my complaint no 2745153 of 9/3 is still to be resolved. Yet they say we care! Capt Sanjay Gupta Mumbai 400 088
IndiaToday,"""Money today"" magazine subscription is waste ",1,"Reasons:- 1.  Delivery will not be in proper.(  2 months in time- 1 month miss- 3 months in time- 2 months miss) 2.  Change of address  will miss 2-3 copies. 3.  Customer service is of completely time waste. Mails response is dead slow- your luck Gift will be sent first, to make people happy first and than the problem starts. impossible to get-back money once paid- even if u don't like the service. if you are a trader, your magazine picks will be outdated by the time you get your copy of magazine. If you are investor, the stock picks depend upon your luck. In my simple words - simply throwing a stone in sea is equal to getting Money today magazine monthly copy in right time. LAST BUT NOT LEAST:- DON'T SUBSCRIBE BLINDLY LOOKING AT OFFERS, BUY IT FROM NEAR BY SHOP AFTER LOOKING AT THE CONTENT OF THAT MONTH LIKE BOOKS."
IndiaToday,Refund not given (following up for 12+ months),1,"Beware of India Today Book(Cheaters) Club. My membership ID with India Today Book Club is ITBC08774081. I had placed an order(TELESALES/0GA090014244) worth Rs.1897/- for Reebok kit(shirt, watch, belts etc.) on 06-March-09. When the ordered items were not delivered after more than 4 months of order, I requested to cancel my order and refund the payment. I have been following up over phone and emails for last 12+ months, but ITBC team is unable to process my refund till today. What should it be called “fraud”, “failure of a REPUTED company in online business”, ""shame"", or what? Is there any chance to get my hard-earned money back? I have provided them all the proofs(CC statements, Order confirmation emails etc) many times and also send letters in writing to their Noida and Delhi offices by Speed Post, but no replies. They do not care for the customers once they got the payment. They have started a new company BagItToday to make more money by cheating people. Thanks for reading!"
IndiaToday,Money Today subscription service stinks,3,"To all those misguided souls who may be thinking about a Money Today subscription, I have one word - Don't!They may convince you with the projected price savings but what good is that when you don't get your issues at all? This subscription is in my husband's name(Maj. Rajinder Singh -Sub No:MONTD1859956) Right from the beginning the Money Today magazine was delivered late. This, I stoically put up with, but this year, they have tried my patience too far. They missed a couple of issues in between for which they were apologetic and said they would add an extra 3 issues to my subscription and that their vendor was a fault. In August they told me they were changing to a monthly frequency and I would have my issue anytime between 25th to 30th August. After the promised issue didn't arrive, I wrote to them for which again they were prettily apologetic(where did you go Rosy from customer care?). Rosy from customer care promised I would get my issue within 2-3 days. 2 weeks have passed - no sign of the issue. Once again I wrote to them and asked them to return the rest of my subscription money and discontinue my subscription if they could not provide the issue. No reply, absolutely nothing.they didn't have the decency to reply.Today it is 27th of September and my issue is still as elusive. I also subscribe to Prevention, India today and Good Housekeeping but now I am seriously thinking if this is wise. the India Today Group seems least concerned about their subscribers or timely delivery of magazines seeing their record with my Money Today subscription. Deepa Singh"
IndiaToday,Greed affecting content,2,"I have been previously accused of being fanatically loyal to India-Today magazine. I have been reading it for almost 18 years. It made sense to go check with the bookstore guy if the magazine had hit the stores. those were days when its analysis was almost like the ultimate truth. In the last few years though, I see a tilt towards more commercialisation-it is as if the owners have been hit by a never ending greed for money. there are more adverts than content. they seem to have started the practice of making the cover page as two-page fold-in that can also carry extra advertisements. I can understand the compulsion for revenue but somewhere there needs to be a balance between commercial intent and political content. For the last few years ""outlook"" and ""the week"" seem to have strongly emerged as competitiors to India today. I prefer to check these three magazines and pick and choose the one that has the best story-India today is not a compulsion anymore. I wish the magazine would have focussed more on content that adverts. the quality of content seems to have deteriorated. I wish they would continue to publish critical investigative stories once again. sigh! There are few cutting edge writers left with the mag-especially N.Prasannarajan who writes hard hitting essays-three cheers to him!"
IndiaToday,Nothing but a SMS Spam Club,1,"This has been posted on other sites by me. please assist me in dealing with this fruad company which distributes SMS Spam better and any company in the world, is housed by sadistic miserable losers and is nothing but a pile of Adil AhmedI have talked to atleast 10 persons from India Today who have assured me that they will remove my number from their database. In their database they have my number listed with the name of ""Sajida Sultana"" and I keep getting unneccary SMSes very often. At present I have 21 messages in less than three months even after I deleted almost the same number of them. I am ready to pay a lawyer to sue them, my frustation has gone to that stage. I dont know how they got my number but if someone can tell me how to make their life miserable and file a suit against them, I am more than ready if they dont remove my number form their database. Its the most pathetic company I have seen, filled with cheap customer service reps and useless managers, looks like only the sms sending server is working in that company. Only profanity comes to my mouth when I think of that company but I am trying hard to control it to respect this complaint board. Please, Please, please help me getting this leeches off my skin.Thanks and Regards, Adil AhmedIndia Today is nothing but a spam distributing company. Please threaten India Today to stop their useless messages from reaching me. I am ready to spend money on a lawyer to make their life miserable if I can to recover the mental damage that they have meted out to me. Their records show my name as sajida sultana and the crap messages never stop even after atleast 10 people from that miserable department have assured me..Adil AhmedEven if this does not help, I will send all the names of the people who assure me henceforth.I have already started sending SMSes accepting the ir offers so I can atleast do some damage by refusing EVERYTIME they send me something. A lot of items are stacked in the RT Nagar post office at preset which I have refused to take and still they keep coming, still I will keep ordering until they stop sending."
IndiaToday,False Advertising,2,"I subscribed to the Mail Today subscription offer which gave a free pair of Reebok shoes with a two yera subscription. I got the paper subscription and the voucher for the Reebok shoes. Armed with the voucher, I went to the Reebok stores and asked them for size 7. The standard answer is that size 7 is not available. The only sizes available are 5 and 10. This means that the average Indian male's size is not available. The Reebok store people were very nice and gave me their number to call. So I called and called but they never had the size. I have a life other than to call Reebok stores. I then called Mail Today customer care. They said that this was not their responsibility. I said that if they are giving this as part fo their subscription then it is their responsibility. They took my number and said that they will call the next day. Two weeks later no call. I then wrote to the India Today customer care email. I got a response from a lady asking for my number. I sent my number but then no response. I think that both Mail Today and Reebok think that Indians are fools. So they can put in a false advertisement and make people run after them for a long time and then we will forget about it. They make their money, do not deliver shoes and we suffer in silence. If there are others who have had the same experience then please let us group together and jointly take action against both Mail Today and Reebok."
IndiaToday,Bogus Group of India Today Book Club (ITBC),1,"India Today Book Club: Just do not tempt to buy from them any time any thing. If any one subscribe for the great India Today magazine for one year (52 issues), I am sure they will get not more than 30 issues or even less. It is perhaps ITBC's corporate policy to mail only a fraction of thier subscribers. And this fraction changes every week, randomly, by computer lottery (perhaps, I guess). I don't think any one will track each week for the magazine for 52 weks, and call them back and ask for replacement. The book club is another major fraud. How can I believe the following:""You are entitled to savings of Rs 5197 on Reebok Fitness kit, Savings Voucher Issued to a Select Few Only ! Get a complete Reebok Fitness Kit worth Rs 8196 for Rs 2999 only"". How can one believe that the kit of worth Rs. 8196 is sold at Rs. 2999. Who fixes the worth or MRP. It is all bogus and marketing tactics. Just be with your trusted vendor of neighbourhood. At least, he will listen to you, for any service. Thanks for reading... Prabhakar Gundlapalli."
IndiaToday,Mail Today Subscription: Do not hope for delivery,2,"Had subscribed for a mail Today subscription for one year starting April 2008. The cheque was given to the vendor and he promised the rest will be taken care of. However for the whole of April, no paper was delivered saying that he is waiting for the coupons. Later after delivering for a few months, he again stopped from December 2008 onward saying that he does not have the coupons and that I should complain to Mail today. I got no response from the number of executive he ha given. So I contacted the Delhi office. I was given a different number to contact and was given a complaint number 1702090026 on 17 Feb 2009. I was told that all coupons were given to the newspaper vendor and he should supply. The vendor says he has got none and I should pay for back papers delivered.Mail Today said the vendor got them sa it supplied coupons till 24 Oct 2008. There is no resolution to the complaint. No one contacted me. if I contact the number is busy or not answered. The website of mail today has no email address for subscription complaints. So I am just putting this message here that if you intend to go for a yearly subscription-- don't.You will be fleeced by the paper vendor and the local executive of Mail today combined.

IndiaToday,Avoid,2,"I have little regard for India Today. It was good earlier when it was the only one of its kind but has been overtaken by Outlook. BTW, I am a paid subscriber to Outlook for past 10 years. Still I used to read India Today in the library often but now I have given up this practice. Their cover stories are pathetic generally. If I want to read about sex preferences I have other alternatives. India Today is a news magazine and should remain as such. Their marketing deptt is also over actice. If they get hold of your email or mobile No., they will pester you with spam for book offers, reward points etc till you finally just delete any mail from them without even opening it. By this time they have zeroed on to other susceptible persons. They even send unsolicited VPP parcels containing books which you realise only after paying for them, at least for the first time. My advice to all, Avoid all magazines of India Today Group."
IndiaToday,India Today  Book Club,1,"They are the Big Cheaters lack professionalism. They advertise anything to get the subscription money from you. I get mails from noreply@offers.indiatodaybookclub.com , citing so many offers. First they offer you free India today book club Membership. Then they offer you useless CDs with the so called Exciting offers. Their free holiday package is also a fraud technique, offer you the destinations which r far away from where you stay. You end up cancelling your trip to far off places. If you r staying in Maharashtra, they won't provide you the Holiday coupons for Mahabaleeshwar, Lonavla, Goa or near by places. You will be given the choice of choosing your destination in Tamil Nadu, Kera, Nepal, Delhi and other far away places. Even they restrict you to choose the prime locations also. Since I stay in Pune, I was denied choosing the hotels from Maharashtra, Goa and Ooty. The CD Package I hv received are of Inferior in quality Subject wise or Materialwise. Then I got a mail from them couple of months back for exciting offers and my eligibility to win sweep takers. For that you need to subscribe ( I don't fully remember the scheme ). Today I got a mail saying that ""Fabulous News! You have won a Phone Voucher worth Rs 3301 in our computerised system of nomination through phone numbers. You are one of the fortunate few to get it."" also I got the same mail on my 3 more different IDs registered with them.

IndiaToday,Free gifts during subscription,2,"Last year-2007, I subscribed to to India Today magazine during a promotional season. I registered for a one year period, wherein there was an offer that a travel bag would be sent as gift . The fine prints were missed by me. After 2 months when the parcel arrived by Post, I had to pay the postman a sum of Rs 700.00 /- to get the parcel. The letter accompanying the parcel said that the parcel costs Rs 700.00 /- and contains free gift worth Rs 800.00 /-. Opening the parcel I found one red travel bag < which would cost rS 150 /- in the market, and two CDs ( Encyclopaedia Britannica Guide to Shakespeare and another one whose title I donot recollect- because I have thrown it away) - both the CDs were found to be blank. These idiots are under the impression that Indian consumers are dumb. These guys regularly send me mail from the id: noreply@offers.indiatodaybookclub.com The last mail says that I am a winner and a swatch watch has been won. I shall have to pay Rs 2999.00 /- and shall get two watches whose cost is 8000.00 /-. I know these guys would have bought Rs 200 worth of chalu watches from the bus stands or railways stations and send these across. What gross misuse of a brand name. If any concerns in this regard, anyone can mail me at angshumanroy at gmail.com"
IndiaToday,India Today (Bengali) : A Good Choice,3,"Currently I read my morning news paper in the Internet. I need to come office early and I do not get chance to buy the Newspaper from the local vendor. I always prefer to read the news with a hard copy at the home in the evening and due to this early shift I missed that. So that was my idea to subscribe for couple of news magazine; also to get some inside and elaborate analytical stories of the actual news. At that time I found that India Today has Bengali edition in their offerings and subscription was not very costly. India Today is renowned name in the News Magazine section but I was not sure how it would be for their regional language division. Still I prefer to taste that. Subscribing Process I visited their Website and they have a online subscription section. I opted for the 1 year plan. It was Rs 449 and also a Adidas bag as free gift. I made the payment and within a month I got my first copy. Here I noticed a difference. I also have a Business World subscription. BW is always sent by ordinary post and often Indian Postal service does not deliver the magazine on proper time or misplaces it. But for the India Today it is delivered by a local news paper vendor and they maintainÂ  a subscription card. Every time I receive it I have to sign the card. So no misplacement, no delivery failure occurs till date. Also we have mutually adjusted for my suitable time to deliver. It is quite good. Contents The magazine appearance is good. Paper quality, printing etc are of good quality. Lots of coloured photograph are there. They cover most of the time current stories, analysis. Almost all the sections like Politics, Sports, Business, Entertainment, Health etc are managed on every issues. Also with every edition they provide another extra different supplementary copy for Women of today's time, on Travel Guide, Health Guide, Employment and Educational Guide. Regarding these supplementary copy, these look repetitive but quite helpful if one are looking for any specific information or keep special interest on. Another thing that I feel good they have a proper mix with the National, International and Regional topics. Regional hot topics are not ignored for the more important national or international news. Some feel good or bad local news are also highlighted. Always More or less they maintain a neutral view and decision is left for the readers. For some other Bengali magazine I found that they generally try to convince the reader whether it is right and wrong. This type of news presentation I feel very irritating. It seems like that they think their reader or viewer are fool and can't think or decide what is wrong or right. For the last 10 months I am subscribing this and would like to renew the subscription. Recently they lunch a new website where you can log in and see your details, subscription profile. You can change your address, or provide instruction to temporarily suspend the subscription, complain about the missing copy, status of the delivery etc. I feel it is a good service for a Magazine subscription. Overall my feelings on India Today(Bengali Edition) News magazine is good."
IndiaToday,Dont expect much,2,I thought since this is the largest selling mag in India i'l go for it. Lets try this out. I had been reading few other mag since the last few years . They all have their own flavor and color. I wanted to try this one out. Well I subscribed for it online for a years subscription. This entitled me for a gift also. I gave my address in Bangalore. The place where I stayed in in the city itself. They couldn't locate it at all. I waited and waited. Finally mailed them asking whats happening on their side ?? Since they couldnt find my place.. I told them to change my address to my official address. Sure they did it. But I started reciveing the copies. Soon I felt I was getting stale news . I looked up on their site. And to my horror found out that I was getting the issues a week later. So the latest copy on the stands was getting delivered to me after a week. Why did I subscribe to a mag then ? And to look at another angle to this I still haven't received both  the gifts I was entitled to . The status on the couriers site shows delivered . But hey I haven't got it till now. I informed india today about this but to no avail. I have got mails from them stating that they have forwarded the issue to some office of theirs !!! Atleast they did that. But nothing has been forthcoming from their side. They have failed to meet the basic requirement of sending me the latest copy of the mag to my address on time. What shocks me is the name this mag has all over india and this is the service they give. I had an outlook subscription earlier they were too good about delivery . I used to receive the issues on time and any customer request was promptly acted upon unlike time wasting tactics that india today has shown me till now.

IndiaToday,India Today Subscribers Beware,1,"India Today Subsciption / Subscirber No: ITE331705 I have a 10 year subscription to India Today with the above subscriber number.  India Today solicited this type of subscription through their magazines promising that subscribing to the above offer will insulate customers from any price increase for a period of 10 years.  However what they have not told is that the supply of magazines will be very erratic.  I have complaining to the India Today vide emails and telephone calls to their customer care for more than 3 months now on the following grounds: 1.  I do not sometimes receive issues of the magazine 2.  Sometimes the issue is delivered very late i.e., almost after 2-3 later issues are in the market - which defeats the very purpose of getting that magazine First they said it is a courier problem - that the courier person was not delivering properly.  They said they will switch to a postal service.  Nowadays with the postal system being so good, I should be getting it in one day but still there are delays of more than 2 weeks when again - more than 2 later issues have come to the stands. On contacting their Chennai office, I am told that since the subscribers in Chennai are low, the subscription copies are received only 3-4 days later than they are found in the news stands and then after that if they despatch it correctly, I will get an issue only when the next issue is already on the news stands. When I asked for a refund, I was told that I should surrender some'Cash Back' certificate for which they have no proof that they have given one like that to me.  So in effect they have stopped my subscription and also not refunding my money. In summary my complaint is that India Today is cheating customers in to entering into long term binding with them.  After collecting the money up front they are not ensuring the proper distribution to the customers and instead trying to go after issue-by-issue customers. I am not interested in my money but I want India Today to publish the following sentence in big and bold lettering in all their communications with the customers where they are soliciting subscriptions: ""INDIA TODAY DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE DELIVERY OF MAGAZINES EITHER ON TIME OR EVER AT ALL.  IN CASE THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE LOW, THERE COULD BE INORDINATE DELAYS IN MAGAZINES REACHING YOU OR SOMETIMES NEVER AT ALL.  CUSTOMERS ARE INFORMED THAT ISSUES WILL BE AVAILABLE PROMPTLY ON NEWS STANDS BUT THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID ABOUT SUBSCRIPTION COPIES"" I have been cheated into entering a long term(10 years) binding with India Today which is almost worth Rs. 11000/-(eleven thousand) calculating at Rs. 20 per issue, 52 issues per year and for 10 years.  That is only the tangible amount.  The government is free to calculate the intangible in terms of value of trust placed on the publication, entertainment and knowledge value that was perceived that will be had by subscribing to this magazine and most important of all the value of cheating and tricking customers into getting into long term binding contracts."
IndiaToday,Never Never & Never go for I today,1,"Quality of the Customer care is simply'-60'. My Problem has started when I have subscribed to India Today through my SBI card in which I was supposed to get some six CDs of my Choice. But I have got only what they desires. For Instance As I am a Scorpian I have opted for the Scorpio CD, but they have sent me a Saggitarious CD, This can be well imagined that what shall I do with the CD? Now the Offer says that I am supposed to get 2Years free subscription but belive me upon several mails, fax and telecons, till I could not able to get the first issue of India today. I can only give my comments on the'quality' only upon the receipt of my first copy. But a Sincere request to all of my fellow friends to not to go for the subscription of India Today."
IndiaToday,Worst Service Award goes to India Today,1,"India Today is the worstly serviced magazine. I have subscription to many magazines but none as poor as India Today. The delivery is late, erratic and poor quality. The weekly issue is delivered almost at the end of the week, there is no protection like plastic cover etc. therefore you cannot tell that after how many hands has it reached you. The supply is erratic i.e you do not get many issues for long periods of time and that is how they cover the heavy discounts they give at the time of subscription. They have a service centre which is called WE CARE. Unortunatelly they also are served by anonymous call centre executive who could just log a complaint and not provide solution to a customer. AFter repeated calls to them and millions of reassurances, nothing happens. Such kind of service is not expected from a leading company like India today Group. I would not recommend any of the readers to subsribe this magazine! SJ"
IndiaToday,Tamil Nadu wins Cauvery,1,"The verdict regerding Cauvery dispute has really benifited Tamil Nadu.In earlier solutions also Tamil Nadu got more share of water , but the crecent verdict gave I think one sided upper hand to Tamils. Karnataka has more draught area, the major portion of Cauvery flows through , as less underground water, even has to give water to  dam less Kerala.What I feel is it had been better if Karnatak would have got as  per earlier settlement portion. I think Tamil Nadu government should show bit generosity in the name of  being Indian or making the part of south  forgetting statehood.This need political approach towards the dispute.This thing unnecessarily will increase the tension along border areas.When the verdict was out, there was curfew in banglore and  some border part of karnatak. Even I feel centrc also should interfere in this dispute.In earlier times former prime minister Vajpayee had shown the interest and matter was somewhat solved."
IndiaToday,Why Cauvery vedict is flawed ?,1,"""I am writing this review in this section as I couldn't find any better section - Apologies"". There is a detailed anaysis about injustice done to Karnataka in the rediff.com link http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/feb/06guest.htm Below is the summary of facts and figures. *CAUVERY VERDICT *Total water availability(per year) in Cauvery- 736 tmc to 740 tmc(in non-distress period) Tamilnadu's Share 419 tmc,  Karnataka's Share 270 tmc,  Kerala's Share 30 tmc, Puducherry's share7 tmc. Where it comes from? For TN: TN will get 192 tmc from Karnataka, The rest 227 tmc will come from its own catchment area. For Karnataka:The water available from Tala Cauvery to Biligundu(catchment area) belongs to Karnataka For Kerala: Karnataka has to give For Puducherry: TN has to give As a last reparian state TN should leave 10 tmc of water in cauvery river, for environmental purpose *Why TN a winner ? *- Based on Interim order, TN used to get 205 TMC of water from karnataka. Now it will get 192 TMC.  But the fact is Earlier point of measurement was Mettur(TN), now it is Biligundlu(Karnataka border). The Catchment area between Biligundlu and Mettur generates additional 25 TMC.  So TN effectively will get 217 TMC(12 TMC More) TN has around 120 TMC of groundwater as TN lies in lower basin of cauvery. This fact is not taken into consideration for sharing by tribunal. TN gets NE monsoon starting from October-December which fills Cauvery which it need not share.  It will also get major part of water from Karnataka between June - September. so effectively Water throughout the year. Why Karnataka a loser? Firstly it has to give 12 TMC extra to TN compared to earlier days.  Secondly Karnataka has very less ground water as it lies in upper basin of Cauvery. Karnataka has more drought area(63.8%) compared to TN(29.2%) in Cauvery basin. Still Karnataka got less water. Karnataka is the only state which has got less share of water proportional to basin area compared to other states. This is inspite of karnataka having less groundwater. State             Basin-area            Water Karnataka     41.23%          36.49% TN                  55.27%          56.62% Kerala            3.33%            4.05% Puducherry     0.17%           0.95% Kerala cannot store water as there are no Dams in that part of Kerala. Karnataka was hoping to use that water till the time Kerala builds the Dam. But according to tribunal, Karnataka cannot use that also, That water also should be given to TamilNadu!  Water requested for drinking purpose by Karnataka was 30 TMC. But it received only 1.75 TMC. Karnataka gets SE Monsoon between June - September, which fills cauvery and major part of that  water is shared with TN.  Karnataka has to release 60%-70% of 192 TMC of water during those months. Although Cauvery river length is greater in Karnataka compared to TN, It has got less share Karnataka requested for 465 TMC. It got only 270 TMC."

IndiaToday,Customer Care,3,"I received a joint offer from INDIA TODAY ""Prize Management Council"" and HDFC Bank ,a 25% reduction on the annual subscription rate, a chance to win Rs 1.5million, and assured special prizes.Being preferred customer and holding an International Gold credit card with a spend limit of Rs 3 lakhs, I filled up the subscription form and returned the prize certificates promptly as advised. There was a great surprise indeed. The form and the Prize Draw certificates were returned to me by the Subscription Department of ""INDIA TODAY GROUP"" by some one signing for Living Media India Ltd stating that ""INVALID CARD NUMBER"". I checked the card number myself and got it checked by a Chartered Accountant who is a friend and finally called the HDFC Card customer care centre giving the number I had written in the subscription form.They too confirmed it is correct. I sent an e-mail to HDFC and India Today as to why my form was not accepted and sent back? I quote below the reply in verbatim ""We have investigated & found that the error took place. due to inadvertant card number in our records, during data input.We deeply regret this mistake, which occured due to oversight by our EXECUTIVE & seek your understanding""  What a word play!!!!! Just to say that the ""out sourced company employee goofed up"" The letter was signed by Ms Archana Dev, Manager -Customer Servicing & Subscriptions, the same person whose name appeared in the INDIA TODAY reviews on CUSTOMER CARE,written in 2004.So she still work for INDIA TODAY, which shows that how much they ""care"" for customers and subscribers?. HDFC Bank passed the buck to INDIA TODAY, stating that they sent the form back without verifying with the Card Division,INDIA TODAY's assurance is that "" this was not meant to inconveninence you or harm your reputation in any way"" Thanks for that statement. INDIA TODAY GROUP claiming the Numero Uno in Communication field in INDIA. The end result is that I have banned any INDIA TODAY group publications from my house hold, and close my banking relationship with INDIA's leading private bank. Both have been duly notified.

IndiaToday,Was once a great magazine,2,"I have been reading IT for over 10 years, and its quality is coming down each week. It has now become a lifestyle magazine, far cry from the new magazine it was once. I can't believe the way sleaze has been dominating this once-great magazine. Just compare the quality of the 25th anniversary issue ot IT with the 11th anniversary issue of its main rival. The quality of the articles in the former pales to that of the latter. (Though when it comes to page3/lifestyle/entertainment stuff, IT wins hand down). One thing I noticed is that the news standards seemed to have slipped after publishers LM began taking up distribution of foreign magazines (Readers' Digest et all) also. Maybe its just my thought. The one thing I respect them is that they seem to be only major publishing firm accepting 100% FDI in print media. Some of the similar blatant-market-supporting publishers raise a hue when FDI in their own sector is being discussed. At least, IT is never hypocritical. I guess IT still has some great reporters with it, but not many issues dealing with real life are coming up these days. I hate to do it, but I am moving away after 10 years of subscription."

IndiaToday,~Going more political~,4,"When I was planning to write this review, I searched for India Today and I found it in news mag section of media, what it is not, it’s not a true news magazine. India Today is an Indian weekly English news magazine, in publication since 1975. India Today is also the name of its sister-publication in Hindi. Aroon Purie is its editor-in-chief from 1975, a position he has held continuously for last three decades. The IT grp includes 13 magazines, 3 radio stations, 2 TV channels, 1 newspaper, a classical music label, book publishing and India's only book club. The expectations with a news mag are very high compared to one genre mags. I am not saying India Today is not good, but there are some flaws in it, which needs to be rectified. Indian user is still wandering for a good non-biased news mag, be it be any magazines like outlook or the week, which are some famous weekly news mags. If we talk about India Today, it’s a very good magazine, if we rate it as a politics magazine, as it is going more and more political issue by issue. Way back when it was started in 1975, it was the lone voice of Indian against the wrong happenings. But today it mainly concentrates on political news. It contains Politics (75%) Other happenings (10%) Literature and art (1%) Cinema (2%) Sports (3-4%) Others (9-10%) If we see the above figures we can’t say it’s a pure news magazine, but yes what it covers is best of the lot. So what is expected from a magazine like India today is giving equal importance to every topic and field. India Today has a weekly circulation of 1.4 million copies and is estimated to be read by 15 million people. suggested reading... It we see in the fortnight segment Frontline is a really good magazine with no magazine can stand in front of it."
IndiaToday,Man on Top or Rear Entry ?,3,"Do you know what an orgasm is? Do you prefer man on top or rear entry? Have you tried oral sex? Would you allow your boyfriend to take pictures of you while kissing or having sex? Have you tried swapping boyfriends? Are men attracted to breasts or butt? Before you get any wrong ideas, these are the questions taken from the latest issue of India Today, where they have surveyed unmarried women between 18 to 30 years of age to know about their sexual preference. I really like India Today and considered it one of the better magazines. But what I can’t understand is that what is the use of such kind of a survey. If it is taken in national interest, then may I ask that how does it benefit the nation by knowing if a girl prefers man on top or rear entry position. Such things are very personal in nature and better be kept within the confines of the bedroom. I am not being narrow minded, but I just fail to see any utility of it what so ever. If India Today wants to suggest that they are doing the survey to know female preferences so that males can understand it better, then I completely disagree. Not all females have same preferences and individual preferences can be communicated to your better half personally. This survey hasn’t really done anything to improve the women’s position in Indian society. In my view, this survey is nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt by the magazine to titillate its readers and earn some quick bucks, which they have been losing out to its competitor Outlook. This is a really sad thing considering the reputation of India Today. Rather than improving the quality, they are going down to such cheap gimmicks. I wouldn’t have been surprised if magazines like Cosmopolitan or Femina came up with such a kind of survey, but going by India Today’s standards it just wasn’t on. This may give a temporary boost to their sales, but in the long run it will tarnish their image. Some years back parents were happy if their child read India Today, but after this episode now they may have to keep a check that their child doesn’t read India Today. I’m not against sex education. I’m against half baked titillating text served in the name of sex education. All in all, I surely do not recommend you the latest edition of India Today. I hope it can come back on track since it’s a nice informative magazine otherwise. Pray that it doesn’t go the Times of India way!"
IndiaToday,Title : Private affair in Public place ,4,"Review : The article and the pictures showed in MID-Day about kareena and shahid kissing each other has brought lots of comments and opinion about the security of their private affair and it has clear a laws that distriubing any private affair between person is violated. A person is not allowed to reveal any kind of private affair in media unless he has been asked to do so, just because to increase the circulation of ur paper. But I would really like to ask the viewer who is opposing the article and picture that what do u really mean by privacy. A privacy which is taken place betwen people in some private place or somwhere in private hidings but the question arise here is what if this take place in a plubic place say anywhere where classes meet for enjoyment. Ccustoms and traditions of our country is very rich and different from the western tradition, and I dont think that our traditions really allow us to do things which are against our rich culture that we are following for so many years. As we are entering the 21st century people may think that we should be modernise and I am not against it, we should look at the future and not the past ,but if we do so then these events should not be matter to anyone but if we do not want to, then the culture must be followed strictly.  I would also like to say that if there is something done with the images of this celebrity just to increase their paper circulation then action should be taken against them so that the media thinks twice before printing such news."
IndiaToday,MEDIA -- A present Scenario,5,"MEDIA -- A present Scenario Pritis Chandra Majumdar There are many very very important issues in Indian politics which are involved with our daily life- leading activities that are ignored now and then by the government and also political leaders of India.. The media should , in these cases can work very honestly and sincerely bringing these matters to the notice of the government and leaders concerned for the benifit of the public who have voted them with a great expectations to form country's a better government. This is their (media) not only a moral duty , but also an ethical duty to the people of our country. But, do we really get it ? No, sometimes a few journalist or media -- may be news paper or electronic media, do compromise with a very important matter or some kind of anti-people activities done by the powerfull persons of our society, or government. Recently, I observed in an article on Uma Bharti( in a leading Bengali news paper), a BJP leader. The coloumnist's contention was that she should give up her saffron coloured saree or dress and government of India should also ban on such person from any people's election for parliament or assembly. He also emphasised that the saffron dress was for the great person like Vivekanand and other saint people who performed their Yog-Saadhana at the feet of Himalaya and thus Uma Bharti should go to Himalaya leaving politics. I do'nt find any valid justification for this arguement except in some personal whim or grouse. There are many comparatively more sensative issues harming society and new generation. Some of them are -- i) Crude Sex and Violence in TV-serial and Cinema which have got tremendous bad affect on children and growing youth of our society. ii) Heavy Corruption among political leaders at higher rank in ministry and Parliament & Assembly etc. iii) Open nexus between political leaders and Mafias & criminals, iv) Heavy income-tax evaders, v) Heavily corrupted IAS, IPS and other all india sevice higher rank holders in government, PSUs , financial institutions etc. Besides, there are many inefficiencies in goverment performances including CAG's adverse reports on government irrgularities in management of finance. Media and honest journalist should hunt about those hot issues for the interest of democracy and people of our country. Each political leader announces his / her promises to do for the improvement of lives and development of his constituency after winning in election. Does this leader keep his / her promises after winning in election ? Definitely not -- otherwise our country could progress very fast and take a higher rank amongst the developed countries, instead of developing one in the world. Is it not a breach of trust against the honest and sincere voters by the political leaders ? How many are there honest media and journalist to write continuously against those cheater leaders in our country ? The true meaning and sense of Communalism and Communal as per dictionery is not explained by the media. Instead, media spreds twisted and biased interpretation of Communalism and Communal , thereby encouraging those leaders to follow the twisted and biased meaning of such sensative words for the cheap popularity and creating sectarian attitude against each other. Media can only save and protect the people's interest and and thereby the pushing our nation to ahead of all developed countries, if they intend o do so whole heartedly and honestly."

IndiaToday,HAVE  VALUE  FOR  YOUR  MONEY,1,"Spending Rs.15 and that too on a magazine like India Today , doesn't really matter. But think before buying the new edition of India Today(of oct.4). Its my kind advice to those people who are MBA/B-schools aspirants.The moment when they see B-schools ratings on any magazines they pick it up without even going through pages . The peculiar rating given by India Today to the various B-schools of India is Difficult to understand especially when u r habitual of reading various surveys of B-schools. I didn't understand the reason for giving Symbiosis & ICFAI business schools the top ten ranking. Moreover this magazine didnt bother to give the pay scales of fresh passouts, which everyone looks for. Besides one section that has given tips on 'HOW TO CRACK CAT' is simply of no use because in that article they have cover the usual things which everyone (MBA aspirants) knows. I was suprised to read a line 'the preparation begins 10 months in advance' its absolutely wrong and if u want to ultimetly get through into the big B-schools u need to start preparing seriously at least 15-20 months in advance. Its because u have enough time to identify ur weak areas and then work calmly upon it. Their stupid advice of not dropping for its preparation is difficult to swallow , when a company offers u lakhs after passing out from that institute , Its a stupidity on ur part for not trying ur best to give a fight. If u wanna drop go ahead but if u dont then its ur choice. Their reports on various institutes is not very different.Altogether they have made a complete mess of the most reputed B-schools ratings. I agree that their unergraduates colleges rating was successful but they completely failed on B-school rating front. It cant be useless but I am damn sure that its not even useful. Insitutes like MDI, SPJIMR are better off than their rating given in India Today. You will develop a wrong thinking regarding various institutes on the basis of this rating.So ,its my sincere advice not to buy it. So Mr. Arun Poorie , Prabhu Chawla(editor-in-chief,editor res.) its a wake up call for u , ur team has got it wrong this time, DONT MAKE FOOL OF US WE KNOW BETTER THAN U."

IndiaToday,A NATION SHAKEN!!!,3,"As I read about 15 reviews about India Today by different people. But I would like to tell you all something about WORLD TRADE CENTRE cover story that has been read by me few days ago. I tried to found it but as I didn't get this topic anywhere I would like to include it there as I read it from India Today itself. As we all are aware of the fact, that world trade center was attacked by Osama Bin laden (AL-QAIDA) terrorists in 2001. Here, I want to write some of my own views abt it. TRAIL OF TERROR! 1.TWO AIRLINES, HIJACKED SOON AFTER TAKE OFF FROM BOSTON AND WASHINGTON. 3.WITHIN THE HOUR, THE PENTAGON IS HIT BY ANOTHER AIRCRAFT IN PITTSBURGH, A UNITED AIRLINES FLIGHT WITH 45 ON BOARD, CRASHES ANOTHER FLIGHT, WITH 65 ON BOARD, TAKES OFF FROM BOSTON ON WAY TO LA, CRASHES AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION WORLD TRADE CENTRE Height: 1,368 and 1,362 feet (417 and 415 meters) Owners: Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. (99 year leased signed in April 2001 to groups including Westfield America and Silverstein Properties) Architect: Minoru Yamasaki, Emery Roth and Sons consulting Engineer: John Skilling and Leslie Robertson of Worthington, Skilling, Helle and Jackson Ground Breaking: August 5, 1966 Opened: 1970-73; April 4, 1973 ribbon cutting Destroyed: Terrorist attack, September 11, 2001 Even as the clock comes full circles second by second, the minutes of the most inhuman massacre of innocents in recent human memory are being recorded worldwide in this hour of reckoning. International consciousness will pause long, and poignantly, on the tale of a city traumatized by terrorists. But time, tide and tragedy-wait for none. FBI RELEASES THE NAMES OF 19 MEN ACCUSED OF MASTERMINDING US TERROR ATTACKS: Waleed M. Alsheri Wail. M. Alsheri Mohamed Atta Abdulaziz Alomari Satam M.A Al Suqami Aarwan Al-Shehhi Fayez Rashid Ahmed Hassan Hamza Alghamdi Ahmed Alghamdi Khalid Almihdhar Majed Moqed Nawaf Alhazmi Salem Alhazmi Hani Hanjour Ahmad A Al Haznawi Ahmed Alnami Ziad Samir Jarrah Saeed Alghamdi Mohand Alshehri THE MAN WHO KNOWS SO MUCH? A man from Mumbai who says he learnt flying with a WTC bomber was picked up by the police. AFROZ He dropped out of college and went to three different countries to learn flying. First, to Australia, then Texas, in the US. Before finally enrolling at a flying school in London for a course in advanced commercial pilot?s English-and religious. Born in the family of a poor tailor, Abdul Razzak, 25 year old Afroz could have been just another youngster who dreamt big-in this case of being a commercial pilot-but the family could not afford to pay for the dream. Enter London-based Uncle Mubarak Musalman. Afrozenrols first at the royal Victorian aero club, run out of the Moorrabbin Airport near Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, in 1997-98, only to drop out. Returns to India. Family persists and Afroz returns to flying school again in 1998-99. This time at the Tyler International school of aviation in Texas, a premier flying club with simulator facility. Once more he heads back home without completing the course. More significantly, Afroz was also familiar with some of the suspects of the 9/11 attack. Of the 19 suspects listed above Afroz seemed to know Ziad Jarrahi and Ahmed Alnami (hijackers of flight 93 from New York to San Francisco which crashed in Pennsylvania) , Nawab Alhamizi (flight77, from wahington D.C to Los Angeles), Mohammed Atta and Waleed m, Alshehri (flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles) which crashed into the north tower of WTC, Ahmed Alghamdi and Hamza Alghamdi (flight 175 from Boston to Los Angeles) which crashed into the south tower of WTC. Significantly, Afroz told the Indian police about the Al-Qaida plans that will be seen nearby in the future by Australia and U.K. IN THE WAR: DANIEAL PEARL Daniel Pearl was not the first to be kidnapped by rogue elements nor will he be the last. But he was unlucky. This general reporter was kidnapped in Karachi. He disappeared after telling his wife he was going to interview Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, leader of the Pakistani militant organization. But as he was so unlucky, he got killed by terrorists even his body was not given by them to his family members. AL-QAIDA We all are aware of AL-QAIDA. But does u really know what it really means? AL-QAIDA means ?the base?. Osama Bin Laden was born in 1957 in Saudi Arabia. He is having his own property of about 300 million dollars. In 1980, he was working as an agent of C.I.A agency of America. But at the same time he fought with soviet-army with the help of guerrillas. At that time it was known that he may fight for ?Jihad? but when in 1990, he started fight with America, he became their enemy. ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER REMINDER One of the most powerful and challenging experiences, hundreds of the youngest children-those who were toddlers three years ago-are only now grasping the meaning of death, the fact that their missing fathers and mothers will never return. But all of the children of Sep 11 are bound that at least one thing: the burden of mourning a private loss that is, at least for the country, historic in stature. Many of the children watched the attacks on television. Year after year they are confronted with an ambush of reminders-at the movies, in class rooms, on a poster at the supermarket. To the children, these are the not the well-worn images of tower falling and planes crashing, but the deeply intimate, divesting scenes of a parents death. In the last I want to include that like any other second or third person I too like to read India Today as this magazine provides information all over the world. If one among all of us don't have a habbit of watching T.V or surfing the net then that person can easily enhance his knowledge about the world by this magazine. It includes everything that one wants to read. I also read about the 13 december attack on parliament in 2001, Phoolan devi's murder(2001) and about mother teresa or diana also. I don't have a habbit of putting this magazine somelsewhere as I'm a person who likes to collecting them. As the above mentioned attacks are known all over the world so it might help others to read about such facts nearby in future. I like to read cover story, sports, cinema, books and the nation. For you all it's really a big review so do spend some time in reading this and let me know about your response towards it!!"
IndiaToday,Why read India Today ,5,"India Today- It is more of an institution rather than a news-magazine. Ever since I can remember I had been reading this magazine. In the early Nineties it used to come out fortnightly. However a couple of years ago it shifted to the weekly format. This was mostly due to the competition from Outlook, Week et al. Now for the review. The weekly version is around 80 pages on an average. This is quite less than Outlook but you will forget Outlook when you open the magazine. The Cover stories are well researched,in-depth studies and most-importantly neutral. No story is biased. Another striking point is the relevance of the topics in your day-to-day world. So you dont get cover stories on College Romances, Lifestyles of the Rich or the like. Then comes their political stories which are quite short and to the point..Thankfully as I cannot tolerate Politics. Here you will not find any bias towards leaders of any particular party or enemity towards some. Outlook readers will vouch for Mr Vinod Mehta's loyalty to the Gandhi clan. There is a section on day to day affairs and the current affairs. Their Defence news is pretty accurate.The Book review is quite good. And yes...lest I forget India Today publishes a rating of the best Educational Institutions of the country once a year. It is a very comprehensive list and is very accurate. And for all you masala geeks it has got a last page filled with the latest gossip and developments of the filmi/high society in India/Abroad. I have many friends who go straight to the last page. There are some special issues and they are really gems. One released on the eve of India's 50 th Independence Day was a marvel. I preserve it even today.Their partition stories will bring tears to your eyes-Guaranteed. Now for the cons- Not that there are many but one of the biggest ones is their staid laid back reporting style.Infact you might tire of their writing style after a while.And their subscription gifts really suck- Big time. You get Cheap Chinese stuff even on 3 year and 5 year subscriptions. Compare that with Outlook where you get expensive gifts -that's when you realise why India Today is losing out even though product wise it is much better than Outlook. But all said and done-It is India's best news-magazine."
IndiaToday,INDIA TODAY,5,"India today I a very good magazine which I like it very much.It covers all the story of the week.It is a very good magazaine which compared to other ones.I can compare it with other magazines but I cant tell you to which magazines I am comparing with because I dont want to tell that this magazine is right or that magazine is wrong because every man has his own opinion .All the fingers are not same all the five are different sizes .If all the fingers are of unity then only hand has come.Like that all different magazines has different specality.Some people like some thing and some dont.So I want to tell you that dont be overconfidence that I was good than you.You were bad when compared to me .So dont Irritate others.If you put others happy then they will also put you happy .They help him when you face difficulty.So PLZ take the gap between rich and poor ,beauty and ugly and many more."
IndiaToday,Everyday want India Today,5,"Really a remarkable weekly magazine for current affairs. Every change in every arena you can cover by India Today. A very good magazine since a long time. Having very wide area in politics, sports, cinema, art, literature, life and creations. Always trying to see naked truth of every incident or accident. Bare facts, good editorial and neutral policy makes it quite strong as a magazine of general people. Having all articles for all except children. Although ''Outlook'' now is available in market but eyes have the habit to see only ''India Today'' because human being are affected from habits. Strong appealing in composing every issue of magazine is beyond comparison with any other and heart touching. About politics the general survey of magazine have full marks in previous years. No doubt about this fact. Coverage is very good. And in last the contest which is covering the 'Wah incidences'' in indian society is remarkable. Further information of Megazine you can get on http://www.india-today.com."
IndiaToday,The leader remains a Leader,5,"I had been a witness ,as a reader, to the changes that took place in India Today over the last two decades.It has transformed over the years,packing more punch in it's pages. The launch and success of Outlook had contributed it's part to this change,too.The competition has brought in some unhealthy aspect ,small issues are being sensationalised and magazine cover is being made more scandalous to hike print order. Big Cars and what not are being offered to subscribers to jack up subscription base... and all this at what cost? As a reader,what I expect is unbiased and truthful reporting.This,I'm afraid will take a backseat in this war of subscription race.The cost might go down,but at the cost of objectivity- that's a big price to pay. India Today,over the last decades has stood for objective analysis and truthful reporting.In the process it has won the confidence of millions of loyal readers like me who tend to believe what has been printed is indeed the truth. Ultimately,a news-magazine can sustain and survive only by getting the support of its readers,not by offering gifts and mega-prizes. If someone had closely followed the growth of news journalism over the years,they will find that the majority of today's news journalists had been associated with India Today over the years.This speaks volume about the magazine,which has become an institution of its own. Prabhu Chawla,the editor,is a veteran and commands huge respect in the political circles.Aroon Purie,the Editor in chief,writes great editorials and is the driving force behind the publication house. I would wish that the magazine should not stoop down to combat the competition,time will tell who is going to rule reader's mind. If you are flipping thru' the pages of India Today,don't forget to enjoy the cartoons of Ajit Ninan Mathew,the best and the most brilliant amongst his peers."
IndiaToday,India Over the Last Week,3,"I have this very weird obsession. Of subscribing to newsmagazines of all sorts. But really, you shouldn’t blame me for it. After all, a five year subscritption rarely comes without an interesting gift. So there you have it- the description of the tepoy in the living room.  Newsweek, Time, the National Geographic Journal, Outlook, India Today, Business Today, The Economist, The Week, et cetera! India Today is a misnomer really. I mean, the name says India Today but it’s a lot of things over the week. And some of them aren’t even about India! There are a few things, however, I have to say about the magazine in general. So let me begin… brace yourself India Today! Like any aglacised-westernized and so called intellectual newsmagazines of the country, this one says so often that it is secular. I won’t say to what extent, but it’s a lie. IT’s language smells a lot of Anti-Hindu opinions. A lot of you are going to disagree with me and again, I can’t blame you for it. What I have said is, unfortunately, true. And really not much can be done about it. (sigh) What I can sense, from IT’s language, is a very wrong interpretation of secularism. I mean, secularism isn’t anti-hindu, or anti-muslim. It isn’t even anti-voodoo. It’s more like trying to help everyone get an opportunity to live life like you and I irrespective of which God they pray to and how many times a day they do that. IT’s job, or anybody else’s job for that matter, is to tell me what is and when it was. Speaking in terms of religion, it’s their job to tell me what the Hindus said, what the Muslims said and what the Christians said and what whoever else said. And that’s it. Opinions are for us to make. It’s their job to give us what we need to make opinions of. Break Something else that pricks me about IT, or, as before, any other newsmagazine for that matter, is it’s habbit of generalizing very fast. A lot if it’s theories are incomplete. I mean to say, they are formed from really small observations. I really won’t point at any specific issues, but it’s something of a trend as far as IT and similar magazines are concerned. IT will come up with a theory about society. You are supposed to read it. And you are supposed to feel awed by it. You are supposed to really believe that, oh my God, the society is breaking up really. You’re supposed to shake awake and say- honey, who gave you that bouquet? And she tells you- you, stupid! Break I am sure you’ll subscribe to find out whether I’ve lied. Do that."
IndiaToday,''INDIA'' TODAY and ''INDIATODAY'',4,"Well, Thanks to Mouthshut Media Competition, I picked to review INDIA TODAY. As I kept on thinking on how to structure my review on India's prominent English Weekly, I struck upon the similarities between ''INDIA TODAY'' and ''India'' Today. Creep below to find the five fitting resemblances of INDIA Today Magazine to our India, and thereby my review. India which seems a dull country, otherwise brims with action when the watchword is Cricket or Cinema. It is when words like ''Sachin'' ''WorldCup'' ''Lagaan'' ''Music'' ''Cricket'' etc, surface, Indians from all places and all quarters are active. Similarly, The India Today Magazine which is just given a wink normally, hits it's record purchase when it has people like Sachin Tendulkar, Aishwarya Rai etc on the cover.And when the Cover Story focusses on practically anything in these two fields.However India Today always gives its readers a good dose of the entertainment and sports news. And What to say their Special Issues on Various The Last Page ''Eye Catchers'' which focusses on people currently in fame, and The Reviews Section give a good dose of Entertainment always.Apart from these sections, India Today breathes enough fire with it's sections ''Cinema'' or ''Sports'', though these sections may not been seen on all issues. Their quality of articles and sincerity of information are unquestionable. INDIATODAY follows INDIA of today in its passions. From time immemorial, there has been a talk of bias between North India and South India, and the North gaining more importance than the South. The strife between Aryaans and Dravidans can be exemplified from India Today, as well. In its major State Scan,there are more news on the states of UP, MP, Rajasthan, Bihar etc, on comparison with those on the peninsular part. However, I would follow the wise man who said ''If there is less news on Southern States, it means they have less problems. If there is more news above the Vindhya, then those people are having a lot of mess''. Neverthless India Today provides regional versions in Tamil, Telugu and they make up for any lack of information.The complaint of bias you can register against India of Today would not be so strong, if you try to do it against INDIA TODAY India which was not such a supporter of Innovations, not long time ago has nowadays recieved innovative offers with firm and warm hands. The revamps in many fields to cope up with Global Standards have mainly taken place because of bold innovations. Innovative Cinemas (say LAGAAN) Innovative players(say Kaif) Innovative Technologies (say MMS), and lot more have been widely encouraged and successful. The India Today Magazine also has carried out a lot of innovations, and the innovations were well recieved. Their section ''Quotes'' deserves great applause for its lovely and well thought contents. Their section ''Tremors'' is also a cool one, which simply says Whats In and Whats Out. The two editorials, one correlating the present happenings, with those of past is indeed praiseworthy. As in INDIA Today, and also in INDIA TODAY, Innovations are happening, as required and they are well recieved. Every day I use the Internet, I am at height of satisfaction thinking of the great changes brought by this technology to my life. All the same, I am also at the peak of my despair, when I see how only a particular section of the India today know and use this immaculate service. I felt the same, when I see that the online services of India Today magazine are restricted to its elite subscribers. The online services of India Today are very attractive, and it is unfair that only the subscribers can use them. A similar line can be drawn to ourselves a priveleged lot, who need to ensure that our underpriveleged friends get to know the nuances of the http://www. To conclude, I think the netizens in India are on the rise, whereas with its increased price (to Rs.15)INDIA TODAY cannot hope of more online people. The online restricted community in INDIA of today is getting less day by day. But the thing cannot be said with the same stead to INDIA TODAY. As in the other parts of the world, as in India, negligence has creeped by large into our society. Living very busily, in an over informed world, we seldom do have time or tenet to follow the problems of our society. We live in a country, where issues get hot instantly, and on creeping of another issue, it becomes unnoticed. From tea stalls to terrain armies, From college canteens to cinema balconies, From slum pathways to super highways, there are heated arguments over any political/social decison that occupies the front the headlines of a day. But the same issue would be alien to one and all the very next day, when other issues creep in. The same happens with Indian Magazines, and India Today is no excpetion. The intensity, with which a cover story is written, you feel that the author would not wink an eye, without finding a solution. The intensity of issues is generated by wonderful newsitems, eye opening articles, superb polls/ analysis, immaculate interviews, and guest articles. But you will find it hard to see a paragraph of the same issue in the very next issue. We are living in this world of Negligence and diversion, and both India of today and INDIA TODAY cannot be blamed for switching interests, and transforming spaces, on a rapid rate.But we have to reorient ourselves, in the best interests of the world. As I see, ''India'' Today and IndiaToday are more or less similar. I like India very much, would love to spend my time in India, and wouldnt bat an eyelid in recommending India to any foreigner. As we all have studied a lot of Geometry, you can infer my views on India Today. You can go for it.."
IndiaToday,India Today's  cool,4,India Today is a good choice . It satisfies the appetite of reader to max. I specially liked the issue about ‘top ten colleges’ and about Verappan .It presents news in a kind of  smooth way that one doesn’t find boring to read on .If u ask me I surely love to read it.The political section is as good as you find mirch masala news at the end. The photographs of various happenings add to its flavour.well I sure do advice its editor to add a bit of INDIA related foreign stuff more to it to make it even more interesting to read. Any travel or any time free I just carry a copy of it to keep me busy for hours together.Life on Sundays is actually boring without magazines like India today.
IndiaToday,Truely Indian,4,"I have been reading India Today from a long time and I should say that I eagerly wait for it every week.Not that I like too much of politics but this magazine gives a lot of other info. too.Every issue begins with a letter from the editor followed by an index and then letters from subscribers.Then comes a an article known as offtrack where some interesting facts about some village in India is given.Then there is voices which include the quote of the week from the world of politics.Somehow I like the statements made by these politicians though some of them seem stupid.Until some time ago there was a cartoon by Ninan which used to be really funny but now it has stopped.After this there are a few pages which cover the important events from across India and even some from across the world in brief.Then come the main articles which include a few from Indian Politics,the world of Entertainment and also sports.Towards the end one will find reviews of Indian books.The last page known as eyecatchers is another interesting page.So if you are an Indian and want to stay in touch with India then this is what you are looking for."
IndiaToday,MAGAZINE-A CLASS APART,4,"CRITERIA: Before I begin to write, right on the subject I would like to prepare a back-ground. News are created every moment, and for that, you have News Channels.For leisurely reading, you have numerous News Papers.Then why the hell should you need something more to read? REVIEW: Let us try to answer this question. Many news are to be read and foegotten. A few are to be traced on tomorrow and the day after.For these, the news papers are more than adequate. When you need to ANALYZE, say the trends in Reliance or the housing cost, or reslt of IAS exam, you need more data at your finger-tips and more authentic formulae to analyze. It is here, you need a magazine who will do it for you. When you want to TAKE A DECISION, say how to save Income Tax, or to put your son/daughter to a medical/engineering college, you need a powerful source to tender you information and a trust-worthy mind to advice. When you want to come to a CONCLUSION, say whether Bajpai's stand on Kashmir is correct, whether Nehru's policy on infra-structure development was right, you need expert's comment. INDIA TO-DAY: With the above pro-logue, I would rate India To-day very high. It brings you opinion of none other than Nani Palkhiwala if it is a budget issue. It brings you Sir Garfield Sobers if it is a matter of cricket. It brings you Mrunalini Sarabhai if it a matter of dances. THE ARTICLES: The articles published in India To-day are always on current issues and the issues of common interest.It quenches your thist and arouses new thirst! It improves your knowledge and makes you more confident about your views and probably decisions. I remember having read a couple of years ago that time of liquid money is coming. Assets may prove less attractive and liquid money shall have increased importance. Don't you feel it is absolutely correct? In the times of beginning of globalization didn't it alarm you to think twice? And how accurate has it been proved? SPAN: The span of subjects covered by India To-day is really impressive. Every one shall have some thing to read and probably read twice! CONCLUSION: In the age of fast moving world, India To-day helps you to keep in pace with the time. PRICE: For a mere 15 rupees,the India To-day is really very lucrative-''paisa vasool''"
IndiaToday,India Today.,3,"Well, in the yesteryears, this magazine was a treat and had a very high quality. SOB SOB, it has gone commercial with a vengeance and how!  First of all, only abridged stories are given in the printed version and they tell that you should see the website for complete story. However, only regular subscribers are eligible to access the site. So you have no option but to be a subscriber. This is a great inconvenience to newsstand reader. They had started mailmetoday.com site which gave shabby service and closed down.(rightfully so!) The quality is still good, but commercialisation takes its toll on the best products. SOB SOB, how the mighty have fallen!"
IndiaToday,Quite readable,5,India today is surely the leader in weakly magzines covering all aspects of life. if u are fond of political affairs india today is the best. they are also covering the current affairs and some discoveries they introduces india to its people they cover all the states. one minus point is that they have not changed their attitue of writing colums.but it is most eagrly waited still they have lack of economic and entertainment coverage. but sometime they provide some fresh news about states of india. some of their articles are really boring but they are way ahead of their commpetitors in hindi and english senctionl. their main plus point is that they provide full news of the weak.
IndiaToday,An Institution By Itself,5,"India Today is a weekly news magazine published by Living Media India Limited. It has a total readership of 15.9 million across all its editions, focusing on politics and current affairs, together with reports, articles and features on art, music, entertainment, sports, book, and above all the social trends. Its Hindi Edition is also named India Today and not  Bharat Aj, the literal translation in Hindi. The Editor-in-Chief is Aroon Purie, and Editor is Prabhu Chawla. The Managing Editor is Swapan Dasgupta, and Executive Editors are Dilip Bobb and Raj Chengappa. Ravi Shankar is the Deputy Editor, and the Associate Editors are Kaveree Bamzai, Ashok K. Damodaran, Rajev Deshpande, Ashok Malik, Sharda Ugra, Farzand Ahmed, Vivek Law and Amarnath K. Menon. The Senior Editors are Shankar Aiyar, Sumit Mitra, Rohit Saran and S. Prasannarajan. Kanika Gehlaut and Nisima H. Khan are the Associate Editors with Joel Rai as the Copy Editor.  It has Bureaus, Correspondents and  Special Correspondents all over the world. The Editorial Office of  India Today is a mini India, and one wonders how the Editor-in-Chief has structured the management set-up. The structure is really complex and with functionaries having all possible designations and working at various levels, it is not known as to who reports to whom. All the same it must be fool proof, otherwise a complete news magazine like  India Today would have been impossible. I have before me the Special Issue dated January 13 2003, with a colourful cover having the photograph of Kalpana Chawla with a very broad smile. The entire magazine is printed in art paper, in one of the best printing presses of India - The Thomson Press. The body copy on the cover is ''The Global Indian DOING US PROUD.'' This issue is Vol. XXVIII, No.2, for the week January 7 - 13. It implies that the magazine is 27 years old. The contents are : Up and Away, The World's a Stage, Gold Standard, Coming of Age, Cricket World Cup, Book Review on House of Spirits, and articles and features by Guest Writers like Dipak Jain, Mira Nair, Farukh Dhondy, Bhikhu Parekh, Rajat Gupta and Swaraj Paul. As far as I know Aroon Purie is a Chartered Accountant by profession, but he has utilised his financial expertise and experience in conceptualising, creating and establishing the India Today empire, which is an institution by itself. The photographs, both colour and black & white, used in the  magazine, either  to support the articles and features, or the advertisements,   are the best examples of photo-journalism.  Every issue of the magazine carries the editorial by the Editor-in-Chief.  India Today has the  India Today Book Club which one can join by paying an annual Membership Fee. It comes to you as a magazine showing the books meant for children and their parents. You can order for the books at very good discounts through major Credit Cards. The Magazine gifts gifts from time to time, if one subscribes for it for a longer period. I can go on, but I suggest that to know more about India Today you visit the website  http://www.indiatoday.com ."
IndiaToday,"The best....For quite some time, now.",5,"I have been avid reader of India Today for at least 19 years now. And believe me it was worth every letter that I read. I have done all my education in Marathi medium and was worried about my English, when I entered Engineering College. Due to my interest in current affairs, I started reading India Today. Whatever level I have achieved in English, a great extent is due to India Today. Contents and Coverage It is beyond doubt that India Today covers India like no one does. All the states are covered through a network of correspondents. The co-ordination of these correspondents with editorial staff in HQ and in the inputs from research really makes the stories worth reading. Even the cartoons of Ajit Ninan have always been scoring hits on the bull! Editors India Today has had number of editors but they have been very consistent. I think they have managed to establish a tradition, a system , a n institution, whereby exit of a editor does not affect overall editorial effort. That is a great sign. Stories Whenever India Today has covered a story it has been multidimensional coverage. Statistics, investigations, comments of ALL sides, interviews ... all add up to an excellent feature stories. Impartiality I think this has been the major hallmark of India Today and certainly the major reason why I still read it even today. In the days when every magazine, newspaper worth its name is having their axes to grind, India Today has tried to be very impartial. You can find Mani Shankar Aiyer, Tavleen Singh expressing two diametrically opposite views..... on facing pages! and I sincerely feel that....IT HAPPENS ONLY IN INDIA (Today). Language While keeping the use of English relatively simple, India Today has helped me in building good library of phrases for my use. I consider the begining and ends of every story or news item in India Today as a lesson in good reporting. Most heartening thing for me is the fact that India Today group has managed to pass on MOST of these qualities to its new sibling Aaj Tak.... Impartial, high quality, quick & fast, responsible. I wish they start similar channel in English!"
IndiaToday,Today and tommorrow,4,"Ideas on paper. Visions, opinions, thoughts, rebukes, comments, skirmishes, achievements, entrepreneurs, sports news, murders, mysteries, business updates all wrapped into one informative bundle, that is ‘India Today’. This news magazine was formerly a bulky fortnightly magazine. It came into action as a weekly magazine about 2 years ago, as a reply to its stiff competitors, ‘The Week’ and ‘Outlook’. They are now marketing the mag in a really wonderful way. They have come up with a contest called the ‘Making Sense of India Challenge’. A very thought provoking and truly challenging contest, not forgetting its lucrative lures. The contest had 8 challenges, one in each issue. Each challenge was on a contemporary social, political or bueauracrat issue. There was an article on the matter and alongside were 5 options to resolve the issue. Readers/contestants were required to rate the five options from 1-5, 1 being the best and 5 the worst. The options were radical and practical at the same time. As citizens we were given the chance of expressing ourselves and being an active participant rather than being a passive recipient. (Although it is a different thing how fruitful or futile the exercise is, that can be judged only if the situation improves) Issues covered were How do we entangle the reservations knot? How do we get NRIs to help India? How do we get better higher education? How do we resolve the Ayodhya crisis? How can the neighbours resolve their disputes? And so on The idea of purchasing 8 issues of this magazine is fixed for a common man. (Coz the more challenges u take part in, the closer you are to the grand prize-Baleno Alturas) Plus the winners are announced 1 challenge at a time. So that makes another 8 issues of purchase. This time along with the winners, the results of the contest are given along with the answer to the previously put question. So a national consensus is obtained. We are all always eager to express ourselves. We love blaming the government for every problem in our life. This was a nice vent for each of us to look at a crisis, consider its pros and cons and come up with possible solutions or remedies to it. India Today has been doing a commendable Job even without the contest. The key regulars include The Editorial-receiving bouquets and brickbats Offtracks: little unusual incidents in the country Newsnotes:comments and Quotes of some people in power, celebrities and so on Religion:a religious aspect for the week Books: book review of the latest book out, also some new arrivals and suggested books for a collector. Sports: sports scene in the country Cinema: news on anything remotely related to bollywood Eyecatchers: people ‘in vogue’ and the ones to have caught in the limelight Neighbours: news from around the borders. Apart from these is the main cover story and loads of articles covering the nation, states, economy, diplomacy, environment and so on. Interviews, opinions, music reviews, latest observed trends in the cities, anything from electronic innovations to cultural imperatives. Each article is sufficiently equipped with photo features, graphs, maps and all other illustrations and depictions all wherever required. It helps a lot if you want to catch up on the events of the week. Something missed in the dailies or even something not featured in the news desks we watch. I feel reading news magazines is a habit one needs to inculcate and then cultivate. It is essential to know what goes on around us. As the citizens of today we need to know the a to z of things. These mags help a lot in forming opinions, moulding them and creating a niche for oneself. The most respected man in the world is the one who is the most informed and well aware of his milieu. For travelers or even long distance commuters this can be a good companion. India today also runs an instant poll via sms. You can take part in it by sending an sms to 2424. you could also receive news by sms on 2424. India today reduced it cost to Rs 10 when it became a slim weekly magazine. Ever since the challenge contest is on it has made the full of it by hiking it to Rs 15. Editor in chief: Aroon Purie Editor: Prabhu Chawla Managing editor: Swapna Dasgupta"
IndiaToday,Buland Bharat Ki Buland Tasveer...,5,"The magazine India Today was the brainchild of Madhu Trehan.She started it as a fortnightly in the mid-seventies.It was a magazine that was completely devoted to honest reportage.The pieces that appeared were well-researched,well written and often well-illustrated.Very soon Trehan handed over the magazine to brother Aroon Purie and went her way.Purie,in due time turned the magazine into a champion of the emerging middle class.He espoused every single cause there was and wrote about it.The magazine ruled this mindspace till Outlook arrived on the scene.IT was forced to turn weekly.The content became less patrician and more jingoistic.However to this day,India Today remains THE magazine which every indian can easily identify with and feel proud of."
IndiaToday,Pros & Cons,4,"Every action has a positive and negative reaction Every individual has good and bad habits,some have good overpowering the bad and some bad overpowering the good. Even a magazine has got its pluses and minuses in it.We need to evaluate the overall plus and minus to come to a conclusion on the overall rating of a magazine. Let me get into the pros of India Today: 1)An in detailed analysis of the cover report with guest columns and giving the perspective of the both the sides is the hallmark of India Today (refer latest IT on Afghanistan special) 2)Images of Afghanistan from 1978 to 2001 (excellent  photography and  good insight of the changes that have happened in that country. 3)Fifth Column by Tavleen Singh, Kautilya by Jairam Ramesh and Politically Correct by P Chidambaram are worth reading and well written. 4)News notes gives me the snippets of the happenings around covering a wide spectrum of the society from politics, music ,health etc., 5)Good coverage of major happenings in the States with the feature devoted to Tamilnadu politics 6)Good articles of Metro today (activities that happen in the metros ) 7)Good review on new books 8)Eye catchers in the last page (devoted to celebrities and entertainments) An overall well represented magazine with good news items that are worth reading The cons of India Today : The magazine has fallen into the traditional trap that all Indians fall into, be it the industry or the magazine or product. The magazine lost out to competition because it could not change with the changing times. Like Bajaj reacted late on scooters , fiat in the cars, India today also reacted late with the other magazine (Outlook scoring over it in terms of content, layout and timing) In the present scenario magazines fall under the Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) category i.e., daily use articles like soaps ,oils etc. As the Fmcg products keep changing in terms of looks etc, the need of the hour is to emulate this category for the magazines to stay in the race. With onslaught of television, news magazines are likely to have a tough task ahead of them India Today definitely needs an overall layout/ design change to make it more reader friendly. Conclusion: My views are India Today should concentrate more on analysis of the news rather giving the news that has already happened ( covered extensively by the television media) There is always an accusation that India Today is pro government, of late it has started being impartial giving views of the both the sides for us to form an opinion. That is what a good magazine has to do I find the magazine slowly and steadily becoming more pro-active. Give it some time I am sure it will bounce back"
IndiaToday,The NewsPaper Today,4,"India today's new website ( http://www.thenewspapertoday.com ), which is also first e-newspaper....its a must see once for all those news lovers out there. U think of subject abt current affairs and they have gotta information on it ( I hope I m not exaggerating it ). They have everything ranging from live coverages,wonderful picture galleries, audios and videos etc. It has already created its place in media world. U will also find all the good journalists writing for this site. Visiting this site is definitely a good experience."
IndiaToday,An aging mastiff,4,"That's the way I can best describe INDIA TODAY. It was a new idea when it began in 1975, because the Illustrated Weekly was dying, and a good news magazine was required. But the style and presentation has not changed over 25 years, and it appears somewhat boring. In this day and age, when television news bulletins come several times a day and internet is even faster, a weekly news magazine seems out of date. Its value is to explain the news that we have already seen or heard, to put in more background and perspective and help us understand what is going on. IT is doing all that. But so is THE WEEK or OUTLOOK. I feel both of them do it better. What INDIA TODAY needs to do re-invent itself, to move away from its style. It should pick up stories behind the scene, or stories that the traditional news outlets are unwilling to take up. Deep-seated investigative stories, for which the TOI or Indian Express are not willing to devote the time and resources. Give us those and we shall return to INDIA TODAY."
IndiaToday,Still Relevant!,4,"India Today published since 1975, now in its middle ages, has acquired a reputation and respectability in India that is unmatched (Comparable to the image of ''Times'' and ''AsiaWeek'' internationally). The magazine has endured even when notables like ''The Illustrated Weekly of India'' had to bite the dust with the changing tastes of the readers. The highlights of the magazine (still applicable) were topical, well researched and illustrated by good photographs. During the Seventies & Eighties, when TV and the electronic media were hardly existing, IT provided a snapshot of the nation's chief events very effectively. As a news / current events magazine, it is still holding the fort, aided by sister editions in other Indian languages. Another chief merit in this publication is objectivity in the articles. However, there is still room for improvement in various fronts. They need to resist succumbing to the pressures of increased readership by resorting to cheap gimmicks. A case to point out is the recent study of cancer in Indian women. While the article was topical, the cover page and illustrations were generally not in line with the image of a respectable periodical (to put it mildly). On the whole I find the magazine still relevant."
IndiaToday,A Magazine of India--Today,5,A magazine of class which provides excellent cradence to the latest events .the latest happenings are caught by india today ppl. and the detains are provided in length.I have been an ardent reader of this magazine for the last 18 years and I affirm my faith in it.lets hope dat it continues catering to the demads of the readers for long .i m a subscriber and is being read by all mah family members.

IndiaToday,Time to rethink guys!,2,"India Today boasts of an enviable credibility and an excellent track record. Check out its latest issue for it has completed 25 years in the market and they are joyously celebrating the same. But I feel, IT must immensely thank 'Outlook' for waking them of the sleep of complacency that they had settled into after years of leadership. They started off at a time when magazine journalism was hardly the order of the day. They were spearheaded by a bunch of rookies like vir sanghvi and others. Over the years, IT has broken a lot of major stories and has now-and-again set high standards of journalism. The only reservation I have against them is their innate affinity for the present NDA government. It is alleged that the ink in IT journos' pens has turned saffron off late. Now, a publication loses its objectivity the moment it starts taking sides at the level of ideology affecting country's policymaking. Thanks to Outlook, the balancing act is slowly getting there. A national publication ought to question government's actions and make it actually perform. The role is akin to that of opposition in the Parliament. Outlook might be scandulous, but at least it gives you material that is different and worth thinking and talkin about. India Today, in that regard rather believes in the policy of appeasement that doesn't really arouse the reader response. I think it's time for India Today to rethink its policy and that too on completing its silver jubilee. Time to work guys!"
IndiaToday,Good Magazine,5,"India Today has come a long way since it’s inception. The thing one admires about the magazine is the clear thought strategy and vision for tomorrow. The magazine has more subscribers then compare to past. This phenomenal achievement can be attributed to focused and unbiased news coverage. The feeling, which a person like me gets about the other magazines, is that other magazines are more interested in scandalous and sensational news without giving any thought to the ethos and morals of fair reporting. Keep it up, you still have a long way to and achieve more success in future."
IndiaToday,Show the real news,4,"India today news I watch dialy morning with my father.it gives leading news of today times.it gives news rural India, cities and international news.it also show real faces of corrupt people, and my favourite show is quiz of news which is held between different talent school children.it also do debate between different politicians and take interviews of famous personalities.its also show business news and stock exchange news.I get updated about what happening in this world in every sphere through India Today.Journals are experts and good in speaking.they give less advertisments and advertisement is also sometimes knowledgeble if it is about some business schools.magzines are also good .but magzine are little expensive but worth it if you want to know about corporate world."
IndiaToday,India Today,4,"My subscription did not start until Oct 20th, that too after my first email to you dated Oct 16, 2015. My subscription was to run from issues dated 20/10/2014  to 12/10/2015. The Mar 16 issue was the last ever issue I received. Several issues before that had either been delivered late or not at all. I had requested, via Case Id 3634554, for cancellation of my subscription with immediate effect.  Also refer to Case ID 3643633 and Case Id 3648937. Kindly refer to all my email correspondence to you. I had not received a single issue after the issue dated March 16. Now after a gap of 5 months you have suddenly restarted delivering issues, with the issue of Aug 17, sent via India Post. It is clear that they have no respect for the customers, but only for their money. Now that they have to release my money, apparently they are complicating the situation purposefully to force me to give up. I sincerely request India Today Top management to display professional behaviour and refund my long-pending money from both subscriptions immediately."
IndiaToday,To the point Content,4,"I am a reader of India today, a weekly magazine which is decades old and since 1975 it is publishing pros and cons of every prominent incident of India. The razor sharp content about every story/news published in it proves the quality and fearless attitude of India today's editorial team, which actually has guts to write about truth and painful realities of this Incredible India.A magazine with perfect news coverage, accurate  content and real value of money."

NDTV is first choice to view out of all news channels all the time, all the time at any circumstances related to news of any level NDTV has the preference in my choice. Best news channel for trusted news no edited news flashed . Interesting news channel for news even boring news also aired with interest language effects."
NDTVIndia,Sold out media,1,The main aim of any news channel is to inform the public about the events happening in the around the world. They have to report the bare fact with all the truth without any bias. Whenever we surf the channels came to NDTV it always feel that we are listening to utter non sense. The anchor always put forward his or her view to influence us to think in a particular direction. This news agency does not put forward the fact as they occurred but always tries to put their own whiminical thoughts in our thought process.
NDTVIndia,Traitors news channels,1,"Dear viewer Please never watch this channel who supports Islamic terrorist, jihadis, always support traitors and terrorist Like kanhaiya, yakub, afzal, kasab, owasi etc. Always hurt the sentiment of Hindus and showed a good picture of Islam. They never shows their bad deeds like jihad, killing or torturing Hindus, torturing womens, invovlmnt of Muslim in crime. They have many thing to say abt RSS but never showed karma of Islam followers. Ban this news channel. Indian enemies like pak China should have funded this channel for Misdirect indian."
NDTVIndia,Conveying Selective truth : Bias,2,"This news channel , earlier I was very fond of has came down in the list of my choicest network.I felt many times that some other news network are indulged in undeclared compaigning and unfortunately NDTV has also joined the chunk. Though there is a lot to say about programmes and presenters but this moment I will be curtailing my views only Bihar election reporting.All popular names and faces are in Bihar and saying its  my native place.blah - blah woh jis ghar ki badhaali bechne nikle ho chahte to use khush-haal bhi banaa sakte the.( now you intend to derive TRP by telecasting poor state of your native , you could have improved the situation by contributing through some efforts) Anyways they have lost it and I am sad about it. The script of presenters is obviously biased"
NDTVIndia,No more Flash Show Only Truth,5,"NDTV India is the best hindi new channel this is the only channel which show true story behind every news. I like to watch NDTV India because here very news doesn't become Breaking News and it does not flash the same news whole day like other channel. I like its graphics is that always shows simplicity. One of the good aspect is this channel does not related to any political party like other channels which always show good aspects of particular parties and never show their bad aspects. NDTV India always show what exactly happen in political passage, capital markets and sports. Some good program that I always watch is Prime Time with Ravish Kumar. In prime times Mr. Ravish Kumar always focus on agenda that is related with common man of India. He always reach that places which shows real picture of India. His talking style is always so simple and and familiar. Second program which I like to watch is Cell Guru which is hosted by Rajiv Makhni. Cell Guru one of the best program and many times It helps me to choose best mobile phone. He shows what new gadgets coming in the markets, what good and bad features of particular mobile phones and many more information that is always helpful to know more about latest mobile technologies. At last I would like to say NDTV India not a channel that always show first Breaking News. It is a channel which first reach at bottom of the News and sort it according to their importance."
NDTVIndia,Prime time with ravish kumarkumar,4,"Ndtv india is one of the best news channel in electronic media.the prime time show telecast on monday to friday in 9 pm.ravish kumar is the anchor of this debate program.issues are take on prime time very valued.ravish kumar has presents this show very smartly. But it has  some casual deterioration.i think ndtv can improve his debate show like apki adalat, seedhi bat, etc."
NDTVIndia,Best among Hindi news channels,3,"There is a whole lot of breed of Hindi news channels in India. This I think in my personal opinion is the best. You can keep watching it for hours without getting disturbed and very very less foolish content. They try to cover the news neutrally but as you know it is not always possible. But, they try try to keep everything subtle and do not shout out loud like other news channels. See the difference lies in even small things like which font they use for headlines, what color combination they are using and off course in what perspective they cover it. When I say it is best it doesn't mean it fast.but quality of programs is good. I like these guys. If you have observed.you get frustrated or exhausted after watching news channel for long time. It doesn't happen with this one. Off course these guys keep repeating.but do not make a bomb out of the news. That is what I like about them. Gofor it in your DTH pack.:)"
NDTVIndia,Ethical News reporting,3,"When I have to watch news on TV I would prefer NDTV as there is less showoffs and only materialistic news is covered without making much fuzz of it. The other shows such as Gadget guru, Raftaar are informative with latest tech and technology & happening in the automotive world. NDTV would be fine boring for those viewer who wants sensationalize News. The support my school campaign & Save the tigers are few initiative taken up by NDTV channel. The only boring segment I can say is the debate hour there is long debate shows telecast on NDTV which sometimes I find useless."
NDTVIndia,Authentic News !!,5,"I am a regular news viewer.Earlier we dont have much options to go through, there were many news which didn't have authentication but shown in T.V.But now we do have various options of watching news.As there are lots of news channels like aaj tak, zee news, abp news, India tv, focus news, NDTV India and lots more. But I prefer to watch NDTV as the news channel is purely content based, no fake news or rumors.It has various shows of relevant features like gadget guru, prime time and all.The anchors/reporters are truly the best among all.My favorite is Ravish Kumar, he is a one the fearless journalist in NDTV.He never afraid of any politicians during his show Prime Time. It doesn't contain any useless entertainment program. Best News Channel!"
NDTVIndia,Great People they got,4,"I think NDTV is the best news channel today. They got some brilliant people in there team. Ravish kumar is one of them and my favorite., his poignant style.and the way he handle the debate is awesome.he is not in mood of fighting by raising his voice. And respect the point of views of the others in debate. That's what I learnt in my personally development subject is correct. Barkha dutt is too good. Doing great discussions."
NDTVIndia,Alok Biyani Kolkata: RIP Shammi Kapoor,4,"Alok Biyani Kolkata: RIP Shammi Kapoor(My favorite actor) Shammi Kapoor Facts - Life History, Films: Shammi Kapoor was born Shamsher Raj Kapoor in 1931. He was the son of Prithviraj Kapoor and younger brother of Raj KapoorShammi Kapoor was initially employed in his father's Prithvi Theatres from 1948 - 1952. His  entry into the world of Hindi films in 1953 was initially a  disaster. Shammi Kapoor had worked with most of the major actresses of  the day like Suraiya, Madhubala, Geeta Bali, Nalini Jaywant and Nutan,  his career wasn't taking off at all. The opportunity came his  way with Filmistan's romantic comedy Tumsa Nahin Dekha(1957) directed  by Nasir Hussain. For the film, Shammi Kapoor shaved his pencil mustache  and cut his hair in the famous ducktail style of the 50s and started  evoking James Dean and Elvis Presly while following the more  freewheeling approach elaborated by Dev Anand in earlier Filmistan films  like Munimjee(1955) and Paying Guest(1957), significantly written by  Hussain. Shammi Kapoor's new haircut and clean-shaven face  suddenly focused attention on his fabulous eyes, which were henceforth  to become his trademark as he melted his heroines with a mere glance.  Aided by O.P. Nayyar's zingy musical score with such foot-tapping  numbers such as Yoon to Humne Laakh Haseen Dekhein Hain, Chupnewaale  Saamne Aa, Dekho Kasam Se and Aayein Hain Doorse Milne Huzoorse, Tumsa  Nahin Dekha made a star out of Shammi Kapoor.This new hip, mod  image was further reinforced in Hussain's Dil Deke Dekho(1959) and  'Yahoo' Junglee(1961) saw him become the definitive icon of the  swinging 60s Junglee elevated Shammi Kapoor to cult status. An  entire decade reeled under its colourful impact as Colour, Kashmir and  Bouffants ruled the 1960s. Shammi Kapoor was perhaps Hindi Cinema's first consistent attempt to address a Westernized teenage audience. Hit  followed hit as films like Dil Tera Deewana(1962), Professor(1962),  Rajkumar(1964), Jaanwar(1965) and Teesri Manzil(1966) swept the  box-office.New heroines like Asha Parekh, Saira Bano, Kalpana  and Sharmila Tagore(in Hindi - she was already well known in Bengali  Cinema) were successfully launched in his starrers. Besides  Shammi's exuberance and dancing ability a large part of his appeal was  also due to the extremely hummable and catchy songs(mainly composed by  Shankar-Jaikishen and O.P. Nayyar) picturised on him. Songs like Suku  Suku, Ae Gulbadan, Govinda Aalaa Re, Deewana Hua Badal, Tumne Pukara Aur  Hum Chale Aaye, Tumse Achha Kaun Hai, O Mere Sona Re, Akele Akele  Kahaan Jaa Rahe Ho, Aajkal Tere Mere Pyaar ke Charche, Badan pe Sitare  and Hain Na Bolo Bolo are remebered and hummed even today. At the peak of his success, Shammi Kapoor lost wife Geeta Bali who tragically passed away due to small pox in 1965. Stability  reentered his life when he remarried Neela Devi, the daughter of the  Maharaja of Bhavnagar a few years later but by now his reign as a  leading man was coming to an end. Increasing age, burgeoning  weight and the Rajesh Khanna wave that swept the nation in 1969 saw  Shammi Kapoor bow out as a leading man. Shammi Kapoor then  shifted to playing bearded heavy weight character roles and wearing  towards spiritualism besides directing films like Manoranjan(1974) - a  remake of Billy Wilder's Irma la Douce(1963) and Bandalbaaz(1976). He was also a well-known computer buff and is the Chairman of the Internet Users Club of India."
NDTVIndia,Best Hindi News Channel,5,"Here, I am going to give my feedback on NDTV India News Channel. Most of the time, whenever I remain at home, I prefer to watch Hindi News Channels but  the quality of news they telecast is really poor and their event manager should think what they are giving to their viewers. From the last week, most of the news channels are showing 1 and only 1 program, all information related to Sania Mirza ( they think, its the only major issue in this country).When you compare NDTV India with rest of the news channels then difference is immediately visible. In all other news channels, all most same news will be telecased in any point of time but NDTV gives a different news like some Documentary on Naxallite cause and problems, some research on the development of backward people in rural areas.. NDTV never tries to earn money by showing some very personal news and never tries to spoil any  personality image. Whether is truth they show only that program at 11 pm every night, every news channel shows only crime and sex related program but NDTV shows Mumbai Central. News Channels should learn some lesson from NDTV India and should try to follow it. I think, News Channles should be more responsible towards the socity because News channels are the only source which can change any Nation's future. I hope other news channels will concentrate more on Rural areas problem,  some documentary on Naxal problems, Unemployment etc. instead of concentrating on same kind of news like whether they are telecasting about Saina MIrza from some days. Deepak Chorasiya (Star News, previously was with Aaaj Tak) is also a good reporter although the news channel is not able to use his services properly. I am surprised that only NDTV India is telecasting news from Naxal areas, like Dantewala, Bastar etc; I think other news channel reporters are not ready to go to that area :)."
NDTVIndia,Best Hindi News Channel,4,"I watch news for about 5 hours a day on different news channel. I believe now a days most of the news channels have nothing to show on because they show more of entertainment and less news. Among all NDTV India is the best news channel which still has some dignity and understand aÂ the brain of a person who is hungry for news. I appeal to our broadcast ministry to take some strong action on such news channel who do not feel responsibility as a news channel and show un relevant programs such as AAJ TAK and INDIA TV. NDTV shows the true story of every news and it has also helped to uncover most of the cases like Jessica lal murder case and recent one is Sanjeev Nanda's BMW case. It is only media's part to check politicians and buruecrats how they work and what they are missing on, NDTV has done it with utmost responsibility."
NDTVIndia,Newsnation.in,1,"Today 23/Jan/2018 at 12: 30 Afternoon Newsnation.in has made an negative impact on our country audience by presenting an live interview with Pakistan Ex.PM Parvez Musharaf. Today whole country knows that daily our soildiers are sacrificing their lives on India Pak Border for the country.In the interview Parvez Musharaf clearly says that during Kargil war He himself was standing inside the LOC on our Indian Hills firing against Indian army men. These coward words are infact demoralising to be heard by the Indias biggest enemy. Though we could not help laughing at the old joker Parvez making silli statements but still some what felt a pain in heart that why is an Indian channel showing this traitor on National Tv and giving an chance to this nincompoop enemy to speak like this right in our face.This is bad, and such interviews of these negative murderer pakistani nationals who themselves have been thrown out of their country should not be shown in our country. And that too at the moment when our Respected PM Mr.Modi is addresing the worlds most power ful nation leaders at Davos.This interview  gives an very negative impact towards Newsnation.in and such useless trp gathering tricks should be avoided. AT LEAST NOT AT COST OF PRESTIGE AND HONOUR OF OUR BRAVE SOILDIRES AND OUR GREAT NATION INDIA."
NDTVIndia,"NDTV is good for social issue, not for politics",1,"NDTV is good channel to raise any social issue. I like its content on subject of social matter like they have raised education issue in some of the backward area in Bihar, Jhaarkahnd, UP and so many state and after that some improvement was there.  One issue like Sonbhadra district in UP where because of power plant, pollution is causing severe health impact but no one take care for them. Like this road condition, malnutrition, etc. When it comes to politics, with the current NDA government, they always stand on negative side of any issue. We can clearly see on their stand on demonitisation, GST, triple talaq etc. On JNU issue, unnecessary they made Kanhaiya as heroa nd supporting other negative politics. For sports coverage, they are good"
NDTVIndia,News,1,I think this channel is very very bad I don't know why he has always support communist and left party I think this channel is try to divide our country he don't care what right or what wrong hey always do criticize our government and system most of time create negative news and his anchor OBC is most baddest anchor in Indian news channel.

NDTVIndia,NDTV India,1,Today's world every one want to to increase rtp of there channel so every one is giving different news.this channel is also like this in my opinions. We should not belived in every news that is given in news . By seeing this news we also belived and trust on that news and many time it happened that people came out to see them
NDTVIndia,PIONEER OF PAID JOURNALISM.,1,Neither NDTV INDIA is most watched ir respected channel. I don't believe in NDTV . It is the most biased and corruptive news channel. It is one of the worst paid media channel. They all are busy in making fake news by hiding the reality. All partners of this news channel are congress people. It is not like I am against Congress but the thing is that this channel is full of corruption. They should dtop the SECULARISM. NDTV INDIA makes their own imagination as a news story and propaganga against INDIA. They are always against BJP. All the Anchors are having negAtive attitude in all the news items and never being neutral. PLEASE NEVER EVER RELY ON THEIR NEWS.
NDTVIndia,"""I Trust Ndtv""",5,"So today I am going to write my opinion about a Indian News Channel Named Ndtv. I like the channel becouse I feel that the channel is working in a right direcrion not for TRP. While other channels are busy debating for vande mataram or bharat mata ki jay, Ndtv raising the voice for sewage cleaners those are not getting the the proper safty to do this tough job, Even a sewage cleaner not getting Protective face mask or splash-proof face shield, so these kind of problems are there in our society we need to talk about."
NDTVIndia,"Ohh, what a biased news channel",1,"What to say about NDTV it is total waste. This channel show the news only anti-national nothing else. If you give some good amount they will show about you also regardless its true or fake. Also I have doubt on this channel that this channel getting fund from Pakistan. Its always favor for Pakistan. This channel very much interested to show anti-national news(ex-JNU issue etc, etc) with pride. I do not know why everytime they are coming to support anti-national. Are they getting money from Pakistan? I am asking this question to NDTV through Mouthshut so kindly mouthshout convey my message to NDTV because I am a very ordinary person I cannot go to NDTV directly so please help me to get my answer mouthshut. This is my humble request."
NDTVIndia,Biased SACH & Pseudo Secular,1,"I have been observing the channel for more than 18 years now and the neutrality has been ever sinking. It has been propagating one particular kind of thought and polity which have been providing shelter to a specific political party. The reasons are quite obvious, the support & aid it needed from the ruling conglomeration and bashing the opposing the opposition. Though I am refraining from naming and shaming but the ideology of the channel has been recognized & commented upon even by the large group of media itself. They have gone to the extent of shaming the Indian Defence Forces by accusing of plotting against the elected government. The irresponsibility of the channel has been further displayed when their reporting was used by the handlers of Paki terrorist to review and redirect their deplorable actions. A govt appointed has to put 24 hrs blank on their telecast for their irresponsible & reckless reporting of a terrorist attack in Mumbai. The govt has been very liberal with them whereas they should have been banned for 6 months at least. The channel has made a lots of money over time due to its good understanding with the longest ruling ideology as it has supported them in times of their need. So they are equipped with the latest infrastructure and coverage technology. They got good coverage capability due to their rich pockets. The quality of the news show is good in terms of presentation but pathetic in terms of neutrality and credibility. Kindly verify for reliable sources before reacting to news broadcasted by this channel. Viewer's discretion is requested."
NDTVIndia,Worst situation of dimapur nagaland,5,"Sir, The situation of Dimapur Nagaland is worst and is beyond control to which not a single legal action has been made. The bandh i.e.'call for total strike' has been imposed by Naga People from Saturday 28 th of January and still today i.e. 3rd February 2017 strike continues. No idea when this strike will end. Not a single case has been made by police personal. Even media too are not reporting the unbearable issue. People are not allowed to walk even on streets. Commn People are facing worst hunger and starvation due to this prolonged'BANDH & STRIKE' over the city Dimapur 797112. Dimapur Municipal Committee have been burned up by local youths i.e.'Nagas of Nagaland' The Internet facilities had been stopped in Nagaland from last week to ensure that no person can share the matters with News Reporters. Also reporters are not allowed to enter the City Dimapur. Moreover, The untolerated and the most painful matter is that all the INTERNET services at Dimapur & Kohima has been disabled. All people are fearing the worst happenings, two civilians are killed on account for election compaign and many more are injured. Our Expectations are. 1.Markets should be open. INTERNET facility should be enabled. People should be protected. Police should do the job instead of closing all servers Internet. Internet should be enabled and media should be allowed to enter Dimapur city. KINDLY update this report to your News Channels sir."
NDTVIndia,True news channel,4,"As we know that all news channel running through TRP.But NDTV never care for any TRP , always stand alone. mainly rabish kumar and Berkha dutta's news analysis are meaning ful and generel public concerning topics.I lyke NDTV Most.current example in monetization period.when other channels airing febricated and screipted news in the mean time team of rabish kumar coverege were make open goverments lieing promises that sotuation is under control. Although, others news channel giving important to TRP Numbr but, I dnt heard NDTV claiming it.never seems bunch of leadrs barking upon each other with any nationel issue.myself think that NDTV Better then othors."
NDTVIndia,Good News Channel,4,"There should be atleast one news app installed on your device so that you can stay updated, no matter in which categery your interest is these app let you select your choices. I saw many news app some were very bad and some has very hard english or very detailed news but this app NDTV official app is the only app that I liked and I am using it from 2 year continuously. There were many bugs earlier still the news shown in this was very clear with photos and videos, the english is not hard too, only simple and easy words are used to convey the news . I would have given it 4 star if the bug was still there but now there is not any issue with it. The app is working amazing, without any error and problem."
NDTVIndia,Ndtv india tops the list of biased news channel,1,It has been a year now since I am Noticing this very tv news channel. I say with authority that is the most biased Indian news channel. This news channel is good at manipulating stories and best known for making ( a hero a zero and a zero a hero). Not only this it is good at trivializing things and portraying a odd and false picture of things. The debates on this channel are totally futile and are pools apart from common sense. Moreover it is full of repeated stories and It appears as if this news channel is meant for fulfilling the interests of vested people. It fails miserably when it comes to the question od promoting national harmony and integrity.I feel pity that in our country which is the biggest democracy still outsources such biased and manipulative media channels.
NDTVIndia,Highle Biased. Anti India Anti Hindu,1,"Shree Shree Barkha Dutt lead NDTV always provoke religion disputes among people of india. They are always in search of some cheap news through which they can get some TRP. During the recent Kashmir curfew, even the opposition  was in favour of Government, this channel was only to oppose the peace steps taken by state government. I had taken pledge to not watch and block this channel from my set top box. May I rate it -5? ha ha ha."
NDTVIndia,Ndtv news! Just boring,2,"What is the duty of a news channel? Experience with ndtv news is very bad,  now a days they stared creating suspense to continue to watch their Chanel,  one word or one line are repeated so many time and in last nothing new they know, just waste of time,  the way reporter says about the news is very stretchend the line which is very irritating."
NDTVIndia,Best News Channel Ever....,4,"Ndtv is best, no. 1news channel in India.This news channel provides genuine information.It doesn't support fake parties or candidates. It is not like the other news channel.I am watching this channel for 3 years. I had never seen that this channel is supporting any fake parties.Prime is the best show of ndtv. Raveesh kumar is the best anchor.I like way he anchor's, his confidence.I will suggest to stop watching paid channels."
NDTVIndia,WASTE OF TIME AT PRIME TIME IN NAYI DULHAN TERE VA,1,"Ndtv is nor New Delhi Television Limited but it is as nayi dulhan there caste. Here I am not joking to you but the news ndtv shows just propelled me do so. Nowadays these news channels has started just making more and more TRP.  Without showing proper news they just concentrate on a particular topic and just aim at any particular groups, organisations or any particular person which helps them gain trip. Earning money is good but you need to maintain your status and show quality news means what is real. Never make partiality with any party or person. This TV just start asking things to any particularl party but just become silent listener at other's activities. They are just paid to do so. So watch any other news channels"
NDTVIndia,Baised,1,"My name is rohit and today I am writing about ndtv news who has always negative thoughts about India and hindu community. They want to prove themselves seculars but secular does not means oppose the hinduism. Lets go through their key points: Host: I do not like their main host barkha dutt, I liked her work in past but now she is not delivering good news, she tries to prove every anti national person as innocent. She always tries to defame our country whenever she attends any international event. She should have some moral responsibilities. Why she did not cover the news of NIT srinagar. Plot: They always prepare the plot to defame modi government. According to them modi govt. did not perform a single good work. I want to ask them why they kept silence before 2014 on these topics. Guys I want to recommend all of you please beware of such channels which plays the journalism of cast, religion and support anti nationals, especially who supports anti army persons. They are not even valuable to single star."
NDTVIndia,Number one news channel in india,4,News ndtv india is indias number one news channel especially it covered all the nationaland  religion news from top to bottom and east to west it covers news debets. And particular issues among all the states recently it covered 4 states elections very very well and every year ndtv news channel rates very positive reviews among all channels acriss india debates will telecasted and promoted very well by ndtv indias news news also understood for every religions people in india
NDTVIndia,News channel with lots of good things,5,"These days when every news channel are running behind TRP,  NDTV is stand alone who gives news instead of nonsense. Ndtv provides me news that are important to me not that is paid or scripted as a drama show. I watch many news channels, most of them showing news for their so called TRP, they have 5-10 peoples at the same time barking while debate. In ndtv you usually saw 2-3 person, debating quite politely and respectfully. In other channels peoples are shouting each other even the anchor shouting or questioning so loudly that speaker of our tv sets gets blast. Whether he is Ravish kumar or barkha dutt or anyone from ndtv, they have a natural way of anchoring that never feels dramatic or scripted."
NDTVIndia,Best Hindi News Channel.,4,"Ndtv India is the best Hindi news channel on the television it will keep you updated in every aspect. They tell the news to the point they won't add some false statements to increase the TRP. Iam watching this news channel from past eight years I also watch other news channels but iam only satisfied with the news of Ndtv India. They won't stick to one particular news for a longer period of time it is the thing which I like. You will get all categories of news like sports, politics, automobiles etc. Raftar hosted by kranti sambhav is my favoirate show all reporters are good they tell news in a very good way. All news are trustworthy you can rely on their information blindly, they telecast many types interesting programme like jai jawan, cell guru etc which is being liked by many viewers including me. I hope this news channel progress more in future and provide viewers quality news every time."
NDTVIndia,Simple and Sober News Channel,4,"There are so many words used to defame News media in India. ""Presstitutes"" in the most common one. For me, NDTV News does not fall under ""presstitutes"" category. This is by far a good news channel and presents news in a very simple way. Either Ravish Kumar's Hindi and reporter or Barkha Dutt's English, all they do is show their simplicity not only in presenting but also in anchoring. Audience are fade up with shouting and sensitizing nothing to make everything. And, NDTV News has stood against this and has done far better job. I like NDTV and rate it 4 out of 5."
NDTVIndia,"No exaggeration, quality news",4,"What kind of development has life style of this world is changed to know happening around you, we have taken the place of how to create it.

They have excellent team of news readers and editors. Best apsect- Real time news from all walks of life are available, It is one of the few channel which broadcast good news and also have good debates on real life issues. They also support good causes like green life  and scholl for all girls, etc. Worst- Content in some segment like entertainment and sports could be better. Also sometimes it looks to be biased to one party. There are lot of advertisement like all other channels. Not avialable in HD Overall this is pretty good news channel  and is one of the best due to its content and fewer ads."
IndiaTV,Most disgusting news channel ever,1,"If you don't want to bang your head against the wall don't watch this so called news channel. Unrealistic baseless news reporting which has no significance for the society, most of the news are of celebrities what are they wearing eating etc. This channel can make news out of nothing and you wonder is this a news?! Your head will go for a spin by watching some of its shows except for one Aap ki Adalat which is anchored by renowned journalist Rajat Sharma and is upto the mark rest of all is utterly disgusting."
IndiaTV,Casteism,3,The c.m. of haryana is  unduly favoring his close friends who are renowed for practising casteist politics. the c.m. is ignoring the welfare of the state and aiding his erring friend  the m.l.a of rohtak district who is a diehard casteist . poeople as the c.m of haryana should be disqualified as the premier head of  the state of a democracy as large as india. the media when informed in time does not take adequate action and then cries in full swing when the tragedy as giant as the nirbhaya tragedy take place. please get into action for redundant social evils still being practised today as casteism in haryana with the full blessings of the chiefminister.

IN THOSE 15 MINUTES THEY  WILL EACH TIME KEEP TELLING THAT ""DUNIYA TABAH HONE WALI HAI 2012 ME"" AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE NO REASON FOR IT."
IndiaTV,News that is Refuse,1,"(Note. I mean all the news channels and not india TV alone) The cricket on the news channel seems to go endlessly.. They have collectively stooped to lowest standards of journalism. Even the bigger channels have got sucked into this vortex of nonsensical drama. They are whipping emotions as if India as a country would change completely if we won the cup. I pray, better sense prevails on viewers and they shun these channels who operate with shoestring budgets and try to proclaim to be 24Hr news channels, which they are clearly not capable of sustaining despite the vast size of this country. There is a rape happening every few mins, a murder or a dacoity every hour, and with the politicians being the biggest culprits there is no dearth of opportunity for investigative journalism. The biggest loser of this balderdash news propaganda is the common man who is systematically being manipulated by false news, blurbs, sensationalism and non-stop adverts. My appeal to the nation is please Demand more from the broadcasters."
IndiaTV,Ultimate nonsense,1,"This goes to the person who will be watching this channel first time. I would like to say that this channel is a nonsense, sensationalizing, fake, BAAKWAS, rubbish, anti Indian, unreal, silly newschannel. All fake news from all places on earth, specially its centre India gets collected\accumulated here. You can watch all nonsense, rubbish, sensationalized, manipulated, silly news articles here. You can say that they have a high degree (like a PHD) in sensationalizing news. Here, even a 1 minute article will become a half an hour program. All urgent news is kept aside and you see all rubbish news.I say that if they want to flash any kind of news, it should not be BREAKING NEWS, but BARKING NEWS! * I would like to give an example of such nonsense article. ""SALMAN NE AAB TAK SHAADI KYUN NAHI KI. BACCHA BUM. KYA HAI SALMAN KE KATRINA SE SHAADI NA KARNE KA RAAZ. BACCHA BAM. JANIYE ISS KA RAAZ, SHYAM SAADHE CHAR BAJE, SIRF INDIA TV PAR."" Now you can understand why I am criticizing this TV channel so much. Overall on me it leaves the worst impression of any TV channel on me. Never watch it. INDIA TV IS FAKE!! FAKE!! FAKE!!!!!"
IndiaTV,They don't have sense of responsible news,1,"Yesterday, they were showing ""DHARTI ME NARK HAI"". There may be an experiment going on in Russia and the scientist heard a voice which they said are of humans. India TV took the responsibility to air this news in India. When I talk about sense of responsible news it means, news channel should not air the news on the basis of Boasting, Speculations, Thoughts or just an expriment. India TV means you are showing a sense of India, you are represnting India through your channel, you are showing whats going on in India. How India concerned about happenings all around the world. BUT what you people are doing is out of mind, you shown CERN experiment in GENEVA in a stupid way, that World is finished now, We will go in BlackÂ whole etc etc. 3 people committed sucide in its fear? Who is responsible? You presented the news based on experiment results odds which were hardly 2 out of 1 millon as per the top scientists. Why didn't you air the news based on EVENS of CERN experiment. Same with this Hell in the earcth news, I immediatelyc alled India TV office and asked about its relevance, may be news is relevant but New chwnnel MUST not show in the way they ususally do. Make the news close to people, tell them It happend and these are speculations, thoughts by the scientists. BUT you treat and present the news in a way like the news is a SOLID EVIDENCE OF HELL, like the thousands of experiment confirmed that there is HELL in EARTH, like Google satelite shown the presence of HELl in EARTH. Don't do that just for increasing TRP, Behave Humans like Humans, Evryone is not educated and TV is in reach of everybosy, poor, illeterate also watch TV, they don't know the technicalities of experiments, they can't read TOI, HT to confirm the news everyday. So please be responsible and air thenews responsibilliy. -Sandeep Garg garg.sandy@gmail.com"
IndiaTV,I love u india tv,5,"Why do so many ppl hate india tv. maybe they expect serious news from india tv. india tv is for us, folks who scour the tv channels for something to laugh about. all hail india tv.... You just have to change your point of view and then you will really appreciate the efforts they put in. Whenever I dont hav anything on tv. the only rescue is india tv. it always has something up its sleeve. from aliens to magicians to conmen to everything... india tv rocks. They have a tendency to sensationalise everything. From amitabh bachchan coughing to rahul gandhi eating dal roti everything is breaking news in india tv. If there was a funny channel challenge, there would be a no contest here. INDIA tv would win hands down. competition would be washed out. Yesterday there was a program about parties that cricketers attend. The title was ""KAUN HAIN NIGHT PLAYER"". As it turned out, it was yuvraj singh."
IndiaTV,"Most Pathetic, Bogus & Unreal news channel",1,"This news channel is an example in showing the heights of Absurd and Untrue news, Just running to fool the people around.This Channel is trying everything to gain TRP but dont know the reality besides everything.They thinkÂ  that defaming Pujya Asaram bapu or showing that UFO's are taking away our cows can help them with their TRPs. People managing this channel please get into real world. News channels are supposed to show reality and not fake themselves with news only to get better TRPs. They dont know that they themselves what they're doing to India.Wake up.Channel showing such kind of news cannot survive for long.Be Real and be informative if you want to persist in the market.By showing such kind of news you can only make people laugh on you. Breaking news and Headlines encompass news like'IG ka laapata mila'.UFO are taking away our cows.I dont know how people can be so stupid for showing such kind of news.I'm not into this business but still I can make out what can be called news. Just to show something for 24 Hrs they're ready to show almost all stupi things And now they got another chance to Defame a Pujya Guru.Wake up.Reporters are not supposed to make news by themselvwe, They're supposed to find the reality and present it to people. Shame on you people, You Yourselves are deafaming your own Sanskriti by defaming such a Pious person.Plz get into reality.I beg you for this"
IndiaTV,"One of the worst, unreliable and frustrating tv",1,"India TV is 100% non-India TV. This channel shows all the nonsense available in the world put together in their news. The main motto of this channel is to sensationalize any ordinary news even though it is untrue, misguiding, harmful for indian people and will strenthen our enemies. This channel should be banned on account of falsley accusing Hindu tradition and beliefs. It is also dis-integrating hindu people and further allowing Christian missionaries to illegally convert hindu people. 95% of news channels in india are financially supported by Christian churches and missionaries and India TV is one of them. Please be aware of these channels' false accusations on a revered hindu saint to publisize Christianity. Everyone who are true patriot of India should condemn this channel and stop watching it immidiately. INDIA TV IS A TRAITOR !!!"
IndiaTV,PURE KA PURA BAKAWAS HAI,1,"paiso ke liye kuch bhi kar sakte hai. are bhaisab sirf paiso ke lie or apna naam banane ke liye kaam mat karo.

IndiaTV,Ridiculous news channel,1,"INDIA TV is ridiculous news channel as it is coming under some third party pressure and showing anything against popular Saint Shri Asaramji Bapu to defame him without knowing reality. It seems this channel is working under some Christian missionary to defame Indian Saints.This is the new news channel and still not known to many people.And with their current performance, I hope this channel will not remain for more days.They should first know the reality of any matter and then only should show anything regarding that. Regarding Asaramji Bapu gurukul issues both in Ahmedaad and Chhindwara it is found that nobody from Asaramji Bapu Ashram is involved in the unfortunate deaths of the two childrens.Police investigation has cleared this fact, still they are showing anything against Pujya Bapuji to defame him and his Ashram.This should stop immediately. They are doing this only to increase their TRP and earn money but they don't realize the fact that their news channel is losing popularity in India as Indians are enough wise and clever to know that this is conspiracy against Asaramji Bapu Ashram to defame him.Peoples will never lose faith in Sant Shri Asaramji Bapu even if they show anything as peoples have experienced bliss and peace in Bapuji's presence.Government must ban this news channel."
IndiaTV,India TV = India's Biggest Liars,1,"This news channel spread what they want to, regardless ofÂ  what the truth is. The manipulate the news and broadcast false information. It should be banned right now. People should stop watching it. They are biggest threat to the media as they are misusing the right they are given. I've stopped believing in this channel. To increase their viewship they can degrade the news quality at any extent. I was looking for a news one day when there was firing going on the our indian border, but these champions were busy in showing the love affairs of celebrities. No sense on airing the news. They just pick a small topic and dramatize it so much that it's unbelivable. People should stop watching it. People should stop watching it. People should stop watching it. For god's sake don't watch it, it will be better if u watch some tamilian movie but not this news channel. WORST NEWS CHANNEL EVER."

Please don;t spoil our country name. Don't just try to  create sensation  and  broadcast wrong news to people. Don’t try to spread illogical and bad news about our culture & Hindu Saints. first u people see the truth find the proof then show on the news.don't just blindily give the news with stupid titles.thats really bullshit All false and unproofed news are been shown in this channel. just don't try to show wat all u want .try to find out the reality. this not only give s ur channel a better hype but also gives respect for the name u kept for ur channel. the government should completely ban this channel, so this channel is not suitable for indians. it should be completely **banned  I personally request u all not to do this kind of work again .as it is hurting more people. u r playing with their emotions. JUST CLOSE THIS CHANNEL."
IndiaTV,Country Name Spoiler,1,"Please don;t spoil our country name. There is only one thing coming from millions of heart.that you will see happening with you. Still one request.Don't try to spread illogical and bad news about our culture & Hindu Saints. O My Lord, Please give them some good thougths. You people still have indian heart, so just pray to your own lord and you'll see what you are spreading will lead to your own destruction. Our India is such a great nation, who respects everybody’s sincere efforts & strong believes in God. Rather than spreading good things about our rich culture, why are you killing yourselves and our people’s precious time and shraddha Please do things that make your channel proud of, instead of breaking millions of hearts. The way you people can not listen single word for your parents, and if some third person put unreasonable & irrational blames on your family, only then you will realiaze how much pain you are giving to so many true hearted people of india."
IndiaTV,Rubbish channel,1,"india tv is not suitable to be a news channel.it has no real news, almost all the news is fake or misguided, sting operations are all fake, , they don't respect  the saints, tell fake things and they gather something but show some other thing . they are under some foreign hands, so they show news which harm hindu community so as to florish christianity but you rubbish channel .your intentions will not be fulfilled.and the reporters also don't apply their brains just to get higher salary or post they show wht their foriegner heads say but they should keep in mind that they are also hindu, so this channel is not suitable to watch . so all the sadhak pariwar don't watch this channel.ok so please don't see this channel and the government should completelly ban this channel, so this channel is not suitable for indians. it should be completely banned"
IndiaTV,Most pathetic Channel,1,"This channel is the pathetic in its style and most screwed up. All the anchors have sh*t in their mind and their body language. I think channels like this should be immediately banned as they are degrade the quality of news and damage the authenticity of the facts. People running this news channel should be punished the way a murderer or a big time sinner is punished and if was the Judge, I would give all of them Capital punishment and much more, so that the people supporting this channel should learn a lesson of this. These jackass folks waste everyone's time by telecasting some crap all the time. India TV should be BANNED and Rajat Sharma along with his associates and sponsors should be put behind BARS and they should be given a 3rd degree treatment as this is what these people give their viewers. Verdict: To be HANGED till death"

They never appreciate good news and they don't care about the society, they just try to create false sensation so that people watch it.

IndiaTV,The only Indian (news) channel reachable,4,"This is written from Northern Part of Africa where we, Indians have received few Indian Television channels through agents like Dish Net. These are mostly pay channels. But we also receive free channels like DD India, DD news, and INDIA TV etc by using our own DISH and Receiver to watch Television. There are no cable operators to provide support like in India (no monthly service charge). This is one time investment (~=Rs10, 000). Local people use Nile sat and Arab sat. But we have additional Dish for Panamsat  to receive Indian Channels besides Dish for Nile sat. We are able to watch Hindi films on Nile sat every Friday from TV channels of Infinity, Bahrain, and Sama Dubai. All are in different time slots and rarely there will be overlapping. But to get Indian news through TV we have to necessarily use Panam sat to the best of my knowledge. Comparing available Indian Channels India TV is the best one to reach us as being powerful signal strength with respect to audio as well as video and associated programs.Geo News (Pakistan) is equally good in reaching us. Other channels have weak signals.While watching some sensitive news or interesting programs picture comes in bit and pieces with deformed and often click sound. It will certainly test the patience of viewers. It is better option to switch over to India TV that comes with quality Pic. Baba list in India TV: It is surprise to watch   babas’ programs that they have nowadays frequently showed.One Baba gives treatment for ghost (bhodh)troubles by slapping fellows who come  with a complaint .Another Baba does cures in limping by one leg on hand, leg, and stomach of the persons who are reported sick, even a small child was subjected to this. One more Baba, age of 14 years old, called Nag Baba gives ashirvadh to drive bad things, another Baba of 1 ½ feet height gives ashirvadh so as people believe that they get relief. List goes on. It is quite interesting to watch this type of program because this entertains us with excitement.. The fact of the belief that people carry is to be ascertainable by some body. Live interview with Public Prosecutor Nigam was telecasted within short period on the same day when the TADA court sentenced Sanjai Dutt , Hindi film actor to 6 years RI. This shows their efficiency and urgency to bring the facts to Public who can form their own opinion about the judgment Just Laugh and Bhaki Maff: Laughing is also considered as a medicine to human being; India TV provides little but effectively every week. While watching this show definitely one will be relaxed beyond doubt Alert viewers: Alert Viewer’ is a program which is by the viewer and for the viewer. It allows the people to raise their voice and bring the issues concerning the society to the limelight. The issues could be related to corruption, antisocialism, crime or any other issue of general public interest India Bole is a chat show in which the viewers get a chance to interact LIVE with the India’s known experts over telephone and fetch the solutions to their problems relating to their health, finance, office, children, society and the other complex and controversial issues which they find difficult to deal with Sting operation: before telecasting any particular event they collected all necessary documents including videos. Super … DERA SACHA SAUDA CHIEF EXPOSED, DRIVER REVEALS ALL.  India TV did not give a chance for the chief to escape. All the angles including his driver interview are covered to ensure that they are correct and their message is True Last week they interviewed with 8-year-old boy and his 6 years old sister to confirm that his father (UP) killed his mother. He was no mood of replying to the questions asked from TV station. For more than half an hour he was practically tortured. Pitiable incidents. At least they should have edited or avoided showing this type of live telecast. They have shown cricket’s scores of test match of India v England. It is little feast for cricket fans. None of our DD channels /free channel have shown like this. On the GuruMandra program the astrologer says many things for the caller question but finally the caller is advised to do some sort of Pooja to get his dream through .if some one has faith in it he/she can simply do Pooja without asking India TV’s Astrologer. I did not fail to observe that they used to show one side story whenever they talked about family issues but rarely both side stories. It is better to show story of both sides so that viewers will come to know whose fault has led the issue/friction to become irrecoverable or irreversible. Animation is always shown wherever their cameramen could not go and click.all of their programs like Aap Ki Adhalat, ACP Arjun, India Beats, Yoga show by Sri Ram DevJi are not highlighted I believe that their programs are repeated three times in a particular day to beam to all global viewers. It gives variety of programs, some may dislike one or two programs but can not ignore this channel altogether. Of course, nither  serial nor film is shown.."
IndiaTV,The name needs to be changed,1,"The Date 12th July 2007, The Time around 11 A.M., The place: South Delhi's prominent Hospital. The Channel on the reception TV: India TV. The viewers: General Patients, Attendants and the Author. Flashing back to days of Shakti Kapoor exposure, once in a while I watched our masala news channels(ITV being one of them) and ranked India TV and Rajat a step higher among equals. But the myth was shattered on the above mentioned instance. India TV continued to flash ""Chamatkari Kabootar"" for straight one hour(or may be more after I left the place thruout the day). The TV footage became so torturing after just 5min. There was no analysis, no references, plain banality. Some stupid Qs from the anchor were being answered by matching alacrity by the correspondent. Is this a news channel supposed to function. There was no problem with showing such a chamatkar, but that can be reserved for a clip or two as a breather between some serious news stuff. To Top it all another news item on some ""Bhaang khane wala Tota"" and beleive me this stuff was equally matching with meeting the lowest standards of electronic media. Surprisingly this also went for straight 20 - 30 min. This whole episode left an indelible mark on the content and intent of India TV. If they accept that this is for general masses who can be gathered around for street shows(Which India TV looked like) or promote superstition, then better change the name to reflect tru identity as this is not the India we are supposed to build and media's role thus becomes crucisl in promoting awareness of the life's facts and india's pursuit to become a developed nation by 2020. This name India should never be used for such non-serious purposes. For a moment if we forget the content, the showcasing of the whole thing was in bad light and taste, with pictures of hanging girl being displayed intermittently under ""Breaking News"" or ""Head lines"" etc. at the same time. To further deteriorate the matter such captions were being displayed continously ""Kisi Ne kuch Nahi Kiya"" ""Police Der se pahunchi"" ""Ladki ka naam - Subhash Devi"". This was horrendous and cannot be accepted on TV. My emotions pour as I see another news channel going down the drain of cheap publicity news and programming. I further feel bad as the Name ""India TV"" should symbolise progress and analysis of true news, dealing with problems in our country, educating masses, generating awareness for physical, mental, spriritual and financial well being. Any foreigner who sees this may impregnate this picture of India. I also feel sorry for Mr. Rajat who with his panache shall always have a special space in my intellect and hope some corrective action is taken to revive glory of news programming in India. Well as I drove on Mehrauli Badarpur Road in Delhi, i just felt amused on various hoardings that were crying out of some Shani Mandir Program and boastfully claiming for getting it Live on India TV. Best Regards, Vikrant"
IndiaTV,Indian TV should actually be Imagine TV,1,"You switch on the India TV channel & in all probability you should find some snake charmer doing something crazy with his Been or you may find few very different angled shots of some pond or some well where India TV reporter would be seriously trying to catch some non-existent ghost on their cameras. That is INDIA Tv all about today. The Breaking News has become a joke:-  with its found anchor Mr. Rajat Sharma accompanied by Sourav when bring you the much hyped breaking news at prime time, you will keep scratching you head to find any main stream news there. When this breaking news came into existence(pioneered by India TV itself), all the channels jumped into breaking news as their exclusive forte, but Indian TV gradually found a strange way & matters to name it as breaking news for the nation. Continuously for some time I can see ""the ghost stories"", ""the haunted manisions"", ""snake-charmers"", ""man turned snake turned man"" doing rounds on India TV's prime time news. It has made the word ""breaking news"" a joke. At most you can find these news cheaply amusing. The sting operation saga, even the India TV founder(& his friends) pioneered sting TV operations have become strange for the channel. In fact these are not strange but disgusting at times. You can easily identify that all programmings & sting operations are doctored and can easily make out that sting-operation targets are in fact acting(and that too pathetic acting). Only saving grace for India TV is ""Aap Ki Adalat"", this too looks funny at times, but still, Rajat Sharma manages to ask some really interesting questions to the celebrities brought in the Adalat. Conclusion:- A senior journalist like Rajat Sharma anchoring a news show(at prime time and named breaking news), which keeps talking about ""snake & ghost stories"" is not actually funny but very very hurting for journalism.Its high time that Mr. Sharma to get up and live up to the name he had made and at least bring some grace to journalism and to the name called ""India"". Or else he should change the name to ""wild imagination TV""."
IndiaTV,Breaking News-How do they manage so many of them!?,1,"""Breaking News"" seems to be buzz word these days for all the news channel. A calf born with 2 heads is categorised as Breaking News by India TV. A mere thought of a mere mortal politicain thinking to resign is also categorised asBN. Aish and Abhishek's pooja was splashed across multiple days and we had sooo many priests and tantriks evaluating what would have been the best possible solution for the Bachchan! Well Big B is bigger than anything in India but worst still, Mallika's fallout on her performance on the new year eve was telecasted for 2 days non-stop by various channels discussing on wardrobe, money taken etc etc. There was no intent of showing how real India celebrated the new year. Has the mindset changed of the Indian public from watching proper news to listening and watching infotainment news? Or is it a ploy working well forÂ news channels to increase their TRPs? Those were the good old days when on New Yrs Eve the channel would telecast the recap of all the main events(National n International). I was shocked to see all the major news channel(AajTak, Zee News, India TV) going for comedy based skits. Have they ran out of ideas or simply couldnt bother to spend effort to show us something meaningful and logical to the nation? People like Rajat Sharma, Prabhu Chawla seem to interview the guests with a sole intention of pulling them down and making them guilty of something or the other. Personally I feel Prabhu Chawla is the worst interviewer, even worse than Simi Garewal. He does not respect his guests and doesnt even let them complete their responses before he fires another irrelevant question. Looks like he is the most jealous person of his guest's achievements. Talking of AajTak, which has claimed to won another best new channel award. I wonder on what basis do the judges evaluate these awards. Almost all of their news reporters are shabbily dressed and sport untidy beards. They conduct reviews/discussions standing and the news reporters rubbing hand in the show suggesting its either too cold in the studio or they are getting bored! Can we urge the goverment to lay down some guidelines to these news channels so that they can differentiate and evaluate as to what be categorised as news and what not. I hope someone from the news fraternity reads this article and discusses the issues mentioned. Hopefully good sense would prevail someday."
IndiaTV,Aap Ki Aawaaz,3,"The way newschannels have mushroomed over the recent years is quite a news in itself.One of them happens to be India TV whose creative head is Rajat Sharma, a well known media reporter of past years.He used to be the popular host of Aap Ki Adaalat which was earlier aired on ZeeTv.The show is now a part of India TV and has been witnessing the presence of a host of celebrities and politicians over the years. There is a team of hardworking newsanchors who bring to light all the latest happenings in the world of politics and media. Those historic sting operations of this channel had sent shock waves around the country and marked its magnanimous arrival.The public reactions which were presented after the controversial piece of evidence against public figures like Shakti Kapoor and Aman Verma was itself too interesting. It is the responsibility of media to come up with such hidden realities every now and then so that the public would be practical in its approach and not fall prey to the gush of emotions for the double faced celebrities. Whether it be Abu Salem’s extradition , Rahul Mahajan’s drug scandal, Rahul Gandhi’s campaigning in North India, the sports update,Rakhi Sawant’s liplock with Mika on his birthday party,India Poll ,music sessions with singers there is a little bit of everything and lots more to look forward to in the form of breaking news. India TV needs to perk up drastically and the quality of news reading has to match up to the expectations of the urban gentry as well.The participation of newsanchors has to be enthusiastic and active efforts need to be taken to hit off well with the viewers.It definitely needs to be more colourful,lively,vibrant and enrapturing to give an upswing to its TRP’s."
IndiaTV,Another rat in the race,2,This is just another rat in the race. Has only helped in increasing the number of channels and hence more labour in surfing TV channels. This so called News channel presents such an absurd news that it is not worthwhile to watch this Channel at all.Especially Rajat Sharma has some problem with his life I guess.His earlier episode--Janta ki Adalat was very good but after he has joined this India TV he has incurred the habit of interfering into the private lives of people. If you have ever heard any news event on India TV you will find that in a 30 minute news session he tends to repeat the Breaking news almost after every minute.Moreover the worst part is the line which you get to hear every now and then is ''Yeh news ya tasweerein sirf India TV ke paas hain aur India TV sabse pahle aap tak yeh news pahuncha raha hai''. And the fact that these news are not very important is the fact that they never follow up unlike AAj Tak or Star News or Zee News on any of the Breaking news that they show.They only believe in making money and creating varied destructive opinions among the public. India TV please don't try to be unique because in that effort you end up showing false and exaggerated news.
IndiaTV,Just For laughs,1,Except for trying to spark communal tensions there other hobby is to find ways to scare people with haux news .. just an anti peace and Anti harmony idiots.. if they dont have news then they create one.
IndiaTV,India TV useful for me,4,Hello Friends most of people actually wants to connect this world through news but I would like to inform you that India TV is very useful and good news channel which shows always real and useful news each and everyday.

IndiaTV,India TV !! Waste of time to watch it!!,1,India TV is an Indian television news channel. Whenever I switch to this channel every-time either they will show some non-sense news or some fake news or some time it seems like they are always supporting some political party. And the worst thing is that they will show the genuine news for very few minutes and rest of the time they will show the advertisements. I don't find it worth to spend time on this news channel because of the poor quality of programs.
IndiaTV,Worst is the only word,1,"If there is any word other than worst I would like to use it for India TV. There is no news ever broadcasted on this news channel which can be appreciated. They only show fake news. India TV should have been banned immediately or it should be listed in entertainment channels instead of news channels. They have changed the concept of news. Number of times India TV has telecasted news as ""Earth will be destroyed by this date"". Oh man! Someone please just shut mouth of that news Anchor. India TV is only misguiding the people. They are doing this only for TRP but they are loosing their own respect and value. They should surrender and start another channel which best suits to them."
IndiaTV,Less News channel and more of a Saas Bahu serial,2,The channel is entertaining as they show some irrelevant shows and news which gather public interest but in point of News channel they are showing anything which doesn't make any sense to viewers. I really appreciate the work of India Tv that how they are making fool of their viewers.
IndiaTV,All programmes based on personal bias,2,Today I am going to make a review of India TV .the so called leading news channel of the India.i have been watching  some shows of it from last 1 year.but except the aap ki adalat I didn't found anyone worth watching.all the shows from morning to evening are worthless.all are based on personal interests and on political forces.what actually the reality is not shown on the channel.this is the situation of almost all the news channel but India TV is leading in this business.it has crossed all such limits.the one programe that I mentioned above is now hardly telecasted once in month that also repeated.the maximum time of channel go on advertising the products of patanjali.they didn't give to public what public is expecting from them.they are full corrupted.they are hidding the reality.
IndiaTV,Only advertisements!,1,Guys this is very bad channel. Any time I selected this channel then there shows advertisements only this channels duty is it long break not shows news or any other thing they matter only for breaks it's very irritated us. Because we want to watch nonstop news or programs but this channel show us only break and advertisements.
IndiaTV,India TV News,2,"Good Day, Viewer my self Imran and today I am gonna share my opinion about a news channel named India TV. I think the channel has become an entertainment channel rather than a news channel ! Many of you would not agree with me, But this is a fact. What India Tv is doing as a news channel ? Nothing just calling politicians to debate on every topic. Did you see Rajat sharma or any other senior journalist went for ground reporting ? No since long time I dint see any senior jounalist went for a ground reporting or raised any issue related to farmers and poor. I know that India TV call politicians and ask tough questions to them as a public representative. Personally I don't feel that it is a news channel, As a viewer I don't find news on it. But to entertain yourself it is good enough !"
IndiaTV,Paid News Channel of BJP,1,I watch many channels but for the last several months I found that India TVâ€™s overwhelming support for BJP and its odd policies. The TV promotes and propagate the ideology of the BJP. They only show the party in good light and never criticize its communal policies. I had also seen the channel comes heavily on various political parities and disseminating wrong news. It is a paid channel funded By Bjp. Mail ID: rahulaggrawal@tutanota.com
IndiaTV,Repeated news everytime,1,"India Tv is a Hindi news channel based in Noida, UP, India.It was launched in 2004.The channel is a flagship service of independent news service.It is a famous channel in india everyone has  seen this channel & knows about it very well.Here I will share my personal review about  this channel & also its pros & cons. Cons- It shows advertisements very frequent It repeats same news every time India TV android app has many bugs It shows irrelevent news  most of the time or may be fake news Radio feature to listen live news stops automatically & it doesnt work in background also so it of no use as you cannot listen while foing some other work so what kind of radio is this, why one would not listen radio instead this. App is not updated timely, bugs are not fixed since months very poor Channel shows itself number 1 channel of india but in my opinion its not, there are many good news channels also it must be in top 5-10 only Pros Along with much cons Channel also has some  shows pros It has android app in which live news channel feature is ok In app photogallery, bookmark, share stories suscribing for alerts feature is ok AAP ki adalat program is good, concept is good, come every week with new face  is also good Overall I will not suggest to watch this news channel instead watch other sources  for genuine & relevent news. Hence I wanna give this channel 1/5 stars from my side."
IndiaTV,India T.v,2,"India T.v  is known as the one of the best Indian news channels in india. But I really hate this news channel. I feel they are very late at their news than other hindi news channels. Entertainment value of this channel is average in my opinion it is not excellent but it is average. Entertainment value should had been better. Variety and programs are good, there are variety of programs like the cricket program, superfast 200 etc. Anchors and hosts are average, the earlier anchors were good then the present one. But they are decent in their job."
IndiaTV,Worst News Channel,1,I really don't like this news channel. It's most of the shows are based beyond the reality. This is the same channel which was to destroy the world in 2012. They simply telecast rubbish news without proper verification just for trp. I had respect for Rajat Sharma. But now I don't like him. Because in his shows he shows only one part of the story. The analysis made by Rajat Sharma is also improper. Worst news channel.
IndiaTV,India TV -Best News Channel,5,"Hello friends, India TV  is a hindi news channel based in Noida, Utterpradesh.India.This channel was launched on 20 May 2004 By Rajat Sharma and wife Ritu Dhavan.The rise of india tv as indias leading news channel, In short period India Tvhas created the benchmark in innovation, impact, rating, time spend, and viwer supports.The India TV channel is now No.1 Position, this channel programs quality is too good and original.India Tv programs anchoring and hosting is too much great.overall is best chanel, Thanks."
IndiaTV,India tv made of news,3,India tv is such a bad news channel. They dont have the news. They creat news for himself. Some shows are really good on this channel like aap ki adalat one of the best show insted of this show I dont think that it is good channel all the news of this channel are fake and made of news. All the stuf on this channel is not likable I think they have to do some orignal work. They get the standard of low of their channel Thankyou
IndiaTV,India TV,5,"India TV is a most popular news channel in all news channels. The TV channel, which is seen as the only reality is the reality of this news is not news it may seem nonsense. Anchors within this channel, which is anchored in language speaks very good. The TV channel, whose name has come to be a show you the most popular show of the same court."
IndiaTV,Best news channel,5,India tv is the the best hindi news channel in india. It covers news across all over india and they post the breaking news first than other channels. Its editor in chief is Rajat Sharma who is a great journalist. The quality of the programs is very good. Especially the report they made is awesome. Aap ki Adalat is the most watching show. It is hosted by Rajat Sharma and every time he brings a new popular trending face to his show. Narendra Modi's episode of Aap ki Adalat tored down all the trps and becomes the most watched show. I like Sourabh Sharma's anchoring most as the style of delivering news is good. Rjat Sharma's Aaj ki Baat is the best prime time show where we get all the news of day in full review. India tv is also on no. 1 in weekly trps where it is to and fro with Aaj Tak to claim first position in trps. I recommend you to watch India tv. Thankyou.
IndiaTV,"News Channel less, Sensational Media more !",2,"It gives news but mainly negative news like murders, robbery, rape, road accidents. Too much negativity , it creats in our minds whenever we watch it. After giving top 10 news of national level, it seems like a local small city news channel. Aapki Adalat is the best programme and very interesting too."
IndiaTV,India Tv : A channel for drama show,1,"India Tv is a news channel or I can say it a DRAMA SHOW channel rather. They claim that they are the leading news channel in India now a days but I don't think so. If you watch the news published on this news channel from to beginning of the day to the dawn, you find that they only shows drama in the name of the news. Like in the morning they shows horoscope, religious shows in which some future teller are telling you your future or your fate which is totally nonsense. After that if they didn't have any GENIUNE news then they started to show some regular daily show's past and present storys or fairy-tale and what is going to happen next in these daily drama shows. They continued it involving bollywod industry, state politics drama etc throughout the day. If they genuinely have a news whose content is genuine and which make sense to general people, they again make and shows the  news in such a way that the main CONTENT or the main PURPOSE of the news is lost somewhere im the dark and only the drama is being continued to play. With Low standard background music and the cheap script language, the anchors continued to overreact on news. Even on serious NATIONAL ISSUE, they didn't have any dignity to show real news. The anchors who are some of the worst in the news anchor industry are being introduced to the people by INDIA TV. The only person who has some REPUTATION is RAJAT SHARMA. I only watch this channel is because of Rajat sharma's AAP KI AADALAT. This program is holding some standards of news anchoring other than that all anchors are selling paid news, news without any real fact or proof just to increase their so called TRP. Even though, now a days I noticed that they started to show rumors which has no legs or just because they are viral on whatsapp. I don't think that they maintain the standard the quality of journalism. I have also compared INDIA TV with some of other foreign news channel like AL-Jazeera, fox news etc and I cannot describe the difference between them. Seriously from my point of view, the channel, not only India tv but every channel who shows these type of drama, should be banned from telecast by the authorities"
IndiaTV,Paid News Channel,1,It is a paid news channel. Rajat sharma is a very good anchor but somehow he has lost his way. even I like the show of aap ki adalat since my child hood but it has lost its credibility in recent years. which is very bad so I dont like this news channel. it is always running one sided or bias news always. I dont like this news channel. I have not expected this from Rajat Sharma who is legend in this field.
IndiaTV,Another worst paid channel,1,This is another worst bias news channel. Rajat sharma has created  his own legacy in last 20 years. He has created his credibility in rhe eyes of public. But he too carried away anf become the bias channel owner. Which is very sad for indian media. I hope that rajat sharma can see this and accordingly changed his way of functioning the channel and content. Bur until than it can be said that it is a worst bias channel.
IndiaTV,India TV,5,I am watching India Tv news channel from the four year. I like this news channel becouse it look fake is not news. Today the human resource of india TV resides among loyal viewers and 500 staffers at that time. And this news channel anchors Rajat sharma and who in their respect . Best part of this channel aap ki adalat hosted by rajat sharma. I like it rajat sharma's body language and art of your speech. And tottaly knowladge about aroun the world then I am open India Tv news Channel. And you can see fastest breaking news. India Tv has state of the art digital connectivity and its broadcast centre covers an area of more than 2.9 acres in sector 85 noida. And I would say you that if you want watch real news then open your Tv and select to INDIA TV NEWS CHANNEL. THANK YOU.
IndiaTV,WORST NEW CHANNEL,2,India TV is a worst news channel.So many you watch that they are giving news about something different which is completely different from the current situation of the city and country.Last when I opened india TV they are giving news about how you can know what is the way to reach at the entry gate of heaven.Whats a silly thing you doing sir I request you to please telecast only News don't other things you are running this channel for telecasting news not to inform about to path of heaven.
IndiaTV,Best channel i have ever seen,5,"I like all news channels but whenever I see #indiaTV I stucked with my television , it is the great news channel, the shows, the anchors, the quality of programmes are great in comparison with other news channels. We can see fastest breaking news on this channel, they are not showing fake news like other news channel, #greatshow #greatanchors"
IndiaTV,Content Repeating channel,3,This is a standard hindi news channel.But the ony thing I do not like about this is that it keeps on repeating the same content several times.The best part of this channel is Aap ki adalat hosted by Rajat Sharma.And sometimes it take too long advertisement breaks which tests my patience.And sometimes it brodcast unreal content which is irritating.But overall it is a good channel.l
IndiaTV,Worst TV channel,1,"First time when I watched India TV they were airing a news on Large Hadron Collider, an experiment to study the big bang theory. I was surprised to know that they showed it in bad light, they came up with all kinds of fictional drama. The anchor said that if this experiment goes further a black hole will be created and earth will be sucked into that. Later they suggested that everyone should lock themselves into their basements and fill them with onions to save oneself from'harmful radiations'. I've never seen such misleading senseless news before. One time they were airing a news item where they suggested that aliens from other planets visit earth and steal milk right from cows' udder. It's a loud channel, with foolish anchors and false news, avoid it at any cost."
IndiaTV,Best News channel in india [ India Tv],4,"India Tv best hindi channel in india.best news show and most popular. The channel was launched on 20 May 2004 by Rajat Sharma and wife Ritu Dhawan.[2] The channel is the flagship service of Independent News Service, which was co-founded by Sharma and Dhawan in 1998.[3] Rajat Sharma co-founded India TV with his wife Ritu Dhawan in April, 2004 from a swanky studio in Film City, Noida, then considered one of Asia’s largest news TV studios. In 1997, Rajat Sharma and Ritu Dhawan set up their own production house –Independent News Service(INS), the parent company which owns India TV. Today Mr. Sharma’s editorial decision-making reaches out to an audience of 90 million C&S homes. The human resource of India TV resides among loyal viewers and 500 staffers. INS has investment from ComVentures, a top Silicon Valley venture fund, and a leading private equity entity. crossed Rs 500 crore in January, 2008 has been rising by leaps and bounds. India TV has state-of-the-art digital connectivity and its Broadcast Centre covers an area of more than 2.9 acres in Sector 85, Noida. Prior to launching India TV, Rajat Sharma was a known face on Indian television since 1992, having previously been the anchor of Aap Ki Adalat on Zee TV and Janata Ki Adalat on Star TV. Independent News Service received investment from Fuse+ Media, an entity of ComVentures, a venture capital firm based in Palo Alto, California, United States with over  100000 of assets under management. Further investments have valued Independent News Service at Rs. 800 crores.[3]"
IndiaTV,"Selling Crap, Not News",2,"There are two types of news channels; one which rely on their content to go through the message and the one which bank upon sensationalism to gain TRP. India TV is the perfect example for the second type of news channel. Ever since this news channel has made its foray into the Indian Media, the news have never been the same. Heavily inspired by the Fox News for presenting news in a sensational manner, India TV has taken the ""sensationalism in news"" genre to an unprecedented height. The content of the news is so simple, yet they unnecessarily present them exaggeratedly. It also has a number of feature series, which are more fiction than reality. The host themselves are always more hyperbolic than real. The same news would be played over and over through the entire day( especially, if its an important news). Viewers literally get bored of their antics and those replays. The quality of news is essentially low and their Representative is even worse. However, the worst thing about the channel is their penchant for creating weirdest punchlines and headlines. If you are still have some doubts, go through their news headlines and you will understand what I am trying to convey here. A news channel's prime duty is to present facts objectively and not to create unnecessary hype. However, India TV conveniently forgets this adage for the sake of gaining TRP."
IndiaTV,Rajat sharma's India tv,2,"India TV is a Hindi news channel based in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.

IndiaTV,Is it a news channel? ? ? !!,2,INDIA TV. the news here would have been as great as the name. But the channel fails to win the people. the news here here are broadcasted in a exagarrated manner. the other thing is it has more advertisements than news.  They stretch the same news more than required. If you are searching for new products in market then watch it for news sake don't watch.
IndiaTV,Advertising is more nd news are less,1,I saw this channel many time but I dont like this channel because this channel have ads more that the news always they are showing ads to the audiense nd showing anything for there trp to get high I dont like this channel this channel doesnt have up to date news this nd I say you to watch news on abp news that news channel is better than india tv.
IndiaTV,Best news cjannel,4,"I also watch the news on the india tv channel. This is best and fastest news channel. In this channel you watch every news on the proper time. India tv news schedule is fix for every news. In this cjannel you watch any breaking news first only on india tv. In this channel every news will be available like sports news, international & national, market and entertainment news. And one I also watch there fast news bulletin superfast 200 news in only 20 minute. In this bulletin you watch every news. This bulletin give more news in sometime. Best thing of india tv channel there interview. In this channel every saturday rajat sharma take interview of any people. And this show is very popular. I also watch this show. This is my best interview show. In this channel every tv reporter give news in few minutes and they are very good. And quality of programms very good. I recommend every people they watch india tv for fast news."
IndiaTV,India TV telecast more advertise less news,1,"India TV is news channel. I use to watch this channel very often. but whenever I show this channel I found that there are more advertise than news. If I can say this in ratio it is around 70 advertise 30 news. This is not effective news channel, except a single show AAP KI ADALAT. If you would watch this TV channel for news than you should at least watch for 1 hour for Little news. This channel provides more adds than news. I would not like to watch this channel, specially for News."
IndiaTV,India Tv,2,"India T.v is a fake news channels, we have many time realize that they are Not giving sure news. First we saw any news on india t.v after any other we will find there is a differences in both the news. Now we try to avoid the channel or if watched then for the comedy news. Some ancors are also looks like a non energytic. I thing if things will continue like this then channel will close one day. They have to improve there sotory there news tjere presentation, anchors and on all enternally things if they wann to remain in race."
IndiaTV,What waste they show....,1,The Chanel is not a  news Chanel its looks like a cartoon Chanel .they never show the real fact of the news but only manipulate the facts . Once they had shown that alien have been found in moon . Why they think that we all are fool that we would see this waste . One more thing you have noticed or not they have been the official Chanel of bjp. While the election in Bihar before the result they declared them the winners .they should also not manipulate the speeches of people as they have been doing.my will suggest just cut this channel from the cable TV.
IndiaTV,India tv the best,5,This time many many satellite news channel telecast on India every channel supports her thinking and her goal many channel supports this type ideology. And next channel supports other type ideology I watch many news channels so I am full confident only some channel telecast real ideology the fit for all national interest and all person in Indian. So I finally realized this India tv is this type channel so proudly her presenter rajat sharma very impressive her thoughts is fit for all nation I like her show aapki adalat they interview all fields like politicians actors religious guru any many her presentation is wonderful I watch regularly all episode aap  ki Adalat long time.
IndiaTV,Funny Channel,1,India TV is a funny news channel and the news they show in it is not realistic. Sometime they tell that world is about to finish and sometime they show a man doing magic and walking in water. I don't believe what ever they say because all there news is based on astrology.
IndiaTV,Should be banned,1,"This channel is such a pain. The news they show are most of the time unrealistic and based on mythical or supernatural things. And they try so hard to make you believe in it. The shows on this channels are so full of ifs and buts making them look fake and waste of time. And when they try to show some real news they distort the facts, stretch the news and repeat the news so much ending up making it boring. The show related to astrology is misguiding and should be banned immediately. In case of political matters the news reporting is biased and targets a particular political figure or party."
IndiaTV,Worst channel,1,India tv is the worst channel ever. It has too much booring events as no one watch it.  I dont know hoe but they always find aliens video as the nasa is still looking for aliens no one has found but india tv did. What a lol they are. Watching india tv is like watching comedy circus it is always funny. India tv should stop thier fake and booring shows. As chootta bheem is more intreasting than india tv. Aap ki adalat was the worst show ever. So I suggest you not too watch this fake channel. And hope my review is helpfull. Thank you.
IndiaTV,Very Real Show And Respectable News Readers,4,"I like all the members of India TV as its brilliant news reader and I respects those who have successful life from their unsuccessful childhood as they really deserves it. Lets talk about an example the boss of it Rajat Sharma who had a life before, that he never hides any thing in front of people so that we youngster can learnt some thing from him. Once it was a time when he saw others as his ideal now he has become our ideal so its a glad to us. All the members are very good and I always love them all."
IndiaTV,Comedy show,1,"They should write comedy channel below there channel name or they just change there channel name to comedy. Seriously what they are doing is foolish I mean who show wierd news on there channel. For example once they show news about cows and then suddendly they introduce aliens in it xD . They should stop this type of nonsence or they should really try in comedy professional. There is lot of news around us but what they choose is beyond this world. Sometimes they show discovery, history channel stuff. They dont know what they are doing, they just managed to live with this channel. There channel only survive because of only and only one show that is aap ki adaalat, which is quite intresting also. That means they have capacity, brain to do something that blows our mind( yeah they are still blowing our brain by showing aliens xD) . I just want to say that Stop this or change this rest is upto them."
IndiaTV,"India TV, Nothing Big As it sound",2,India TV is that the joke in the name of reports/news channel. Aside from AAP ki Adalat Show no alternative show is eligible enough to be telecast or display on this very news channel. This channel is nothing a lot of concerning stupid and very pretend news round the globe than the particular news. It's a similar channel that once telecasted a very popular show like Mil gayi Swarg ki Sidh and the very patal Ka kua. Seriously seeing this channel is  waste of time and should not be airy instead place lets it within the class of comedy channel.It is sensible for few laughs than much far from news.
IndiaTV,A joke in the name of news channel,1,India is the joke in the name of news channel. except for AAP ki Adalat no other show is eligible enough to be telecast on a news channel. This channel is more about stupid and fake news around the globe thn the actual news. It is the same channel which once telecasted a show like Mil gayi Swarg ki Sidhi and patal ka kua. Seriouslyy this channel shouldn't be aired or else put it in the category of comedy channel.It is good for few laughs and far away from news.
IndiaTV,Instead of News they show everything.,1,India tv is worst tv news channel. Instead of news they show everything. on this channel we see most of the time stupidity they dont focus on breaking news. This channel only focuses on stupidity. Totally biased channel always support congress means defender of congress and adversary of bjp. Also quality of programs is poor. dont waste your money on such stupid channel eliminate from your package to save money and purchase other valuable channel.
IndiaTV,Worst channel for news,1,I have watched india tv channel for news but this channel telecasts very disgusting news to people. The news they telecast is nwver usefull to anyone. Also the headlines of the news that they telecast is the worst. This show telecast news as example shown below Foreg: a snake catches a fish to eat and comes out and India tv will telecast this news as See a snake that saves a fish from Drowning.  This snake has so mucb of humanity for fish. India tv must improve their standards so that they deliver some good news to people of india.  They should also telecast accurate news and not the news which is Made by them.
IndiaTV,Never watch this channel,2,"India TV is worst news chaneel  due to its bad shows. All the shows which shown in this channel should be banned accept Aap Ki Adalat only the show Aap Ki Adalat is giving some base to India TV, but accept that all the news on in this channel  are either unrealistic or fake. After watching half an hour of news from this channel you will find only some genuine news. India TV makes some news which is unrealistic in nature for example one episode was there where India TV told that science has introduced some Technology by which rain is possible anywhere, anytime whenever we want. It also makes some news which makes us frightened, for example it told that Earth is going to destroyed in one month or like that .So I will suggest never watch any show from this channel except aap ki adalat , you can trust on Aap Ki Adalat because it is best."
IndiaTV,Woast channel every news shown again n again,2,I like india tv but I say woast because the one news can repeated many times and not show any news content direct to you they show you in main matter of the news in so late in first they are just wasting time to show repeated portion main content to be shown in last between this ADs are shown I will not say say the channel provide you fake news they provide real news. And I mostly saw the rajat sharma show app ki adalat in india Tv
IndiaTV,This channel finds the way to heaven..,1,"Hahahha. India TV once claims that they got the way which leads to the Heaven. Lol. I wonder how they can even show this kind of news. My personal opinion about India TV is that that it is the worst news channel of India. I would never subscribe to this kind of news channel but as I got GTPL cable connection, it comes for free. The news that they show you is designed and manipulated news and thinks that now it will get the attention of the public. Even a simple news, that can be end in 1-2 mins, max 5 mins, can stretched up to half an hour just to keep public wonder. quality of program is also very bad. In my opinion, no one should watch India TV. In comparison to other news channel like India today, NDTV etc are way way better than India TV."
IndiaTV,Leading news channel,5,India tv is one of hindi language news channel in India. It also most popular news channel. It telecasts 24 hour latest news.I used to watch this channel for news.it was launched by 2004.i like to watch this show app ki adalat which host by rajat sharma. I never miss to watch this episode. It airs on Saturday at 10pm and it also repeat at sunday.India tv views mostly range in right wings spectrum. It is used to telecast good special story.you found this channel every dth and cable connections. India tv win many award for its fastest breaking news.raja sharma host app ki adalat is the famous show in India. I watch many news channel but India tv is the most rating channel.I recommend.
IndiaTV,Worst Channel ever,1,"This is the worst channel on tv which is always showing the fake news or the most stupid serials ever in the Indian history. They are always trying to mould the news in an other manner to attract the viewers only. They always just showing the fake news, they dont think of the authenticity or the image of the people they are destroying by showing the fake news. You cant rely on the news shown ny them at all."
IndiaTV,Always show waste news,1,This news channel always show the waste news which never relate to common man they never had the news about what is happening in the environment or in India or world they always talk about rubbish things which no one likes the only good thing about this channel is aap ki adalat other things of india tv are just waste
IndiaTV,I am confuse... its horrible or comedy...,1,I don't know why people watching this type of news channel. this channel is not a news channel its just kind of joke of news. if any one will be serious about the news that person will never watch this news channel. no seance. fake creativity. no seriousness about the news. no such a good argument. And Mr. RAJAT SHARAM(apki adalat) totally useless show according to me.who will take it seriously? who will trust on this type of show its not a show some kind of joke I think. rajat sharma is the most senior but they behave less than new news anchor. according to me this news channel is totally useless. if you are getting bore than you can watch this news channel.
IndiaTV,Very poor quality channel,1,India news channel is very poor quality channel. Its Channel head is rajat sharma. He is very good host but on this channel many news are fake and incorrect and not proper. On this channel programme quality is very poor and not attractive. On this channel best programme is janta ki adalat and other are bogus and worst. I am not recommwnded it and dont waste your time and money on it.
IndiaTV,India TV,4,"India TV is a 24-hour Hindi news channel. We can get the latest News Headlines from India, breaking news on Indian politics, government and much more on India TV. India TV established its image as one of India's leading credible news channels, and is a preferred channel by news lovers. India TV is the best and one of my favourite new channel. This channel provides the regular and accurate information to the viewers. They can never broadcast the fake stories. News which can be broadcast on this channel is full of facts. They can never stick with only one news. They can also broadcast the speed bulletins in which we get informed with number of news stories in few minutes."

IndiaTV,Worst TV News  Channel,1,"If you want to watch something apart from News, then there is this channel called India TV.This channel provides baseless, most irritating news to all. Either this channel provides laughter as they themselves calls them a news channel. You have cows associated with Aliens or something bizarre. More or less, I would suggest Indian Audience to watch more authentic and actual news and switch over to some other news channel."
ABPnews,ABP NEWS,5,"Hello friends today I'm reviewing ABP NEWS, ABP news is one of the best news channel, it has some very good anchors who speaks in limit and they have good command on Hindi language. During the election results I prefer to watch about news because abp news is so quick and shows reliable results. Abp news is available in severasl reasonal languages.  Reasonal Channels are ABP Ananda ABP Majha ABP Sanjha ABP NEWS is being broadcasted on almost every DTH and cable operators here are the list of the channel numbers Tata sky Channel   504 Reliance digital tv. Channel 406 Dish tv Channel 569 Sun direct Channel 133 Airtel digital tv Channel 250 Videocon d2h. Channel 301"
ABPnews,Propaganda Channel,1,"This channel is the hub for biased reporters. Full of Anti BJP and pseudo secular journalists. They'll always ask soft and buttery questions to Congress leaders and once any BJP or other nationalist member is being interviewed they start asking shamelessly rude questions and almost try to frame the interviewee and trap him to speak what they want to hear. Extremely biased reporting esp. by dibang and the panelist dubey who is an AAP member I wonder how they include him as a senior journalist. Overall a rubbish propaganda channel like NDTV, avoid watching at all costs to save the integrity of our nation."
ABPnews,Too much repeated news..,1,"ABP news is one of most nonsense news channel.ABP only shows are only meant for there TRP purpose .most of the news shown are of no use , like during T20 world they came up with a nense show which repeats multiple times instead they could show some stuff which is really valuable beside coming up with a show which give their opinion on other should perform and that so by the people who does not relate with cricket. They also telecast some shows which increase disbelieve among the people .This channel is should take their responsibility more seriously."
ABPnews,Abp news channel worst in news channel s,2,Whenever I think of media in my mind I found it as a powerful tool for sharing any information or experience . But abp news channel do not comes in this category . Whenever I go or visit to this news channel I always founds that the news which are coming are related to indian television serials . Although every news channel do this but it should be under limit. News anchors are also not very good . They do not create any influence on me . Apart from these they show many news events in highly manner . For eg we can take the case of jnu in which they said unstoppable of kannaiya . I think such news channels should not be there which only increases your number of channels .
ABPnews,Please do well....country first,1,"Today I am sharing my opinion on Kanhiya's( JNU Leader) matter and the telecast over there of ABP news. when I think about media, first thing which click in my mind is prosperity, Integrity.last months to till now a matter of kanhiya was very rough social drama presented by ABP news including some more news channels. I ask to ABP news that who give you certificate to judge the person that who is wrong and whos is right. you know very well that we have proper and efficient judicial system in our country taht why you people are making confuse to indian people for just silly TRP's. You ought to understand that country first then why you are making these type of issues in wrong way. Being an indian I am requesting to you people that don't do this. this is not your profession. please do the work actual. not dramatic. otherwise you people will lost your fame just for some people who are entertaing to you for just own profit. So please take care.and show news actual, don't create it."
ABPnews,Do not watch... ABP NEWS.,1,I don't like this news channel because there is nothing helpful to understand the new and the debate. if we will talk about the news and debate on this channel than thats all are very much helpless for every one. if you will watch the debate than you will realize the anchor will not give the chance to complete the view of guest. and if the guest will go against the anchor or the ideology of channel than they will never give them chance to say there complete view. but if guest is favor in kennel ideology than you have full time to say. deepak is one of worst anchor of this channel I think that man think there is no one more intelligent than him self he think he is the best but according to me he is a worst debater of this channel. news is fine but they manipulate the news according to their ideology. really I dont like this channel its worst channel of the news.
ABPnews,Undigested Waste material,1,"Even don't want to say anything about this waste news channel. It is such a disgusting news channel it always propagate foolishness, and try to present news as they want. Sometime it looks like they are only favouring one particular party. I become so angry when I see them supporting some people who spread hatered. Sorry guys I don't have much to share with you people about this channel because I don't even able to tolerate its nonsense for 1 minute."
ABPnews,News should be News!!!,2,"We all know that news channels play a very important roles in current world where we do not have time to go through the long newspaper consuming 3 to 4 hrs, specially when these channel have the ability to create a wave of thought in people mind. ABP News channel should be more cautious while selecting their approach towards these sensitive topics like JNU. It looked like they were puppet in some oneâ€™s hand."
ABPnews,Extra mirch masala :@,1,I know guys all news chanels are good because its also provide letest news for all they should do their duties properly and honestly. But media channels like ABP news are worstly performing their duties. I got fed up their negative news.  Even they do not follow news they try to create it.  Oll of us know that they have been linked with congress : @  party. From the time bjp gets in center and abp gets rn delhi they feel lile orphans. Please shut down this channel rather that show wrong news : @ Thank you
ABPnews,Paid media,1,ABP news is one of the worst channel.It is totally biased channel.it never show the truth over many issues. ABP news is a paid media.it is biased for some of the party because they are getting money from them. ABP news always create to violence in the country.such news from this channel breaks the unity in the country.this types of news will divide our country. You should not watch this news channel.if you really like news on television then go for Zee news or India tv.
ABPnews,Bigoted Channel,1,"It is bigoted news channel to the political party. This news always always supports his favoured political party and also most of the show on this channel are just like a time waste Some of its shows are sansani, sas bahu sajis, mann ki baat etc are the worst shows of ABP news channel. They drive their news channel by the advertisements in every 4 to 5 minutes and we see lots of annoying ads. Moreover, Zee news and India TV new channels are far better then ABP news channel. In the afternoon, it only focuses on saas bahu saazis rather than important news. ABP news channel is for those peoples who needs to limelight and of-course this channel is not good at all. If you see this news channel you will always notice in argument between the Congress party leaders and BJP's leaders . ABP news always support congress party and it works as a defender for congress. So, this news channel is not neutral at all."
ABPnews,One of biased channel,1,"India is ruined by politics, and these channels are their advertiser. ABP news is also one of the advertiser. This news channel have some awesome anchors but content is not at all good. Most the news display specially related to politics are biased. They just unveil one side of the coin, this is clearly understandable. Most of the time they display entertainment news like movies tv shows advertisement. Most of the news are repeated. They rarely do any research or exploration at all. Sometime it feels like we are watching some masala movie channel rather than news channel. After watching this channel for sometime you feel like, was there any news displayed till now."
ABPnews,Good,5,"Abp news is best channel among all news channel.i despise every single other new channel.they are constantly upgraded with the ebb and flow subjects that are going on and doesnt show other senseless topics.they have assortments of projects and my best program is ramrajya.i just trust abp channel they just spotlights on the nature of their programs.other news channel dependably indicate numerous promotions while demonstrating news and I need to look for news in little space in my television however abp news doesnt do this. they likewise have exceptionally capable journalists and hosts who present news in extremely suspicious manner.anchors who host faces off regarding and so forth are extremely taught and sharpminded persons they take great meetings and verbal confrontations from government officials, performing artists etc.they have extensive variety of projects going from music, sports, dramatization to meetings banters about etc.if any one needs to see trustfull news watch abp news. All world hindi news just on this channel and I want to watch it.nice hosters arrive on this news channel.it is exceptionally costly channel ever plzz subscribe to watch every single world new just on ABP news.it regards watch and I m reaaly fulfilled by this channel."
ABPnews,BIASED NEWS CHANNEL.,2,"ABP NEWS channel is biased news channel to poltics party it always supports his favoured politic party also most of the show on this channel are time waste like sansani, mann ki baat etc. also they drive their channel by advertisement in every 3 to 4 minutes we see lots of advertisement. Zee news and DD news channels are far better then abp news. abp news focus on only saas bahu saazis. This news channel is for those people who needs limelight and this channel is not good. If you see this channel you always notice in argument between congress and BJP. abp news always support congress it work as defender for congress this channel is not neutral."
ABPnews,Detailed News in ABP News Channel,3,"Once upon a time APB news channel was known as STAR News channel and also famous for Hindi news at time also. After some years it become APB News and from then till now it is ABP and doing a great job in Hindi news channel field. ABP news channel is providing all type of news related to National, International, Boolywood, Government and etc. The news channel is working well in news field and always serves detailed news to the viewers which are best thing about them. I used to watch ABP news channel and would like to say to everyone see this channel for latest and detailed news."
ABPnews,Good but still not the Best,2,"ABP news is a popular and leading news channel. A lot of people talk about it. That's why I subscribe to it. In comparison to other leading channels like Aaj Tak, ABP News has still to do a lot of work. Level of reporting, detail of subject matter, and manner of explaining that how the news is connected to audience is lacking. I mostly watch it in the evening, that's when ABP News airs a debate called ""Bada Prashan"" . It is generally a good show with anchor giving equal chance to every participant with a very unbiased approach. But when the participants and also the anchor start shouting, it gives me a headache. My suggestion to other viewers interested in watching debates to try PrimeTime on NDTV India at 9 pm."
ABPnews,ABP is still balanced,4,Now a days when media is totally sold to power and money ABP is still balanced and doing good. I generally hang on it as it is first news channel on my videocon D2H but it holds me on and I dont bother my remote much axcept there huge commercial breaks. In old times we used to go to see Ram leela and in between ramleela if some one use to donate 50 or 100 Rs every body on stage has to freeze & announcement of the name of donor happens in between & then show used to proceed.Times has changed but rule is same lolz.
ABPnews,"ABP News, Quite Professional A TV News Channel",5,"After coming from the day long work place, when you desire to relax at home, it will be extremely amusing to sit before the TV and switch on to ABP News TV channel. It has become one of the very few most popular TV news channels today with a fantastic TRP. I am a regular viewer of it and very much motivated to bring a brief review about this channel. About The Channel: On 18th February 1998, when there were very few TV channels were available on cable TV network(no DTH was there then), a new news TV channel by name'Star News' came live on Indian TV network that belonged to famous Star group of TV channels. Hard work of its journalists and the administration made this channel extremely popular among the people of our country and it emerged as a perfect yard stick of professional journalism in our nation. In the year 2012, this channel was procured by Kolkata based Anand Bazaar Patrika(ABP) group and since then it was renamed as'ABP News' what we see today. Range of Programs: It is basically a news oriented channel and known for its news coverage in a quite professional way. Famous journalists like Vijay Bidrohi, Deewang, Abhisaar, Romana and Kishore Azwani are the main attractions of this channel. A program called'Khabbar Dinbhar' runs most frequently that updates with recent news materials.'Aaj Ki Baat' is another debate show that involves invited guests from different political parties and experts to discuss on a current affair. This is very informative and interesting as well. At 8 o'clock in the evening, a program called'Aaj Ki Taareekh' is another news analysis program hosted by Abhisaar is a brainstorming program too. At 10 o'clock in the evening, '24 Sahar 24 reporters' is a news coverage program that covers the news from all corners of the country.'Wah Cricket' is the sports program hosted by Romana is very interesting involving experts like Manoj Prabhakar, Vinod Kambli and Murli Kartik.'Press Conference' telecast at 8 o'clock in the evening on Saturdays is the main attraction of a week wherein a guest(usually political leader) is questioned by four to five journalists rigorously and hosted by Deewang. DTH Service: ABP News is telecast on channel number 454 on Tata Sky, 406 on Reliance Digital TV, 569 on Dish TV, on 250 on Airtel Digital TV and in many other DTH services too. A lot more can be written on this channel, but I could point at a few important features that I thought necessary. Please rate how's that. Thank you."
ABPnews,Usless news,1,"ABP news commonly known as star news is the worst news channel in this channel there is debate organise and political leaders from different parties fight against each other on topic which is none of their concern. . sometimes it ends up hitting someone face or by disrespecting someone sometimes I think one of the lier of the country is the news channel to gain popularity their reporters can do anything even if a severe victim dying on the road they will not help them and ask them how did this happen who was behind you, where is your family and lots of irrelavant question why guys if your father is victim would ask the same or take him to the hospital, you must be correct if you are making others correct you need popularity and you guyss can do anything for that."
ABPnews,Bed,1,I wanted to do a quick review on my experience with bank of baroda.Bank of baroda is a nationalized bank and has continuous competition from other private banks in regards to customer service quality.I have been a saving account customer with them from last few years now. When I opened the account just like every other bank they handed over the e-banking details and informed that the password would arrive in 7 days. One thing about the e-banking with this bank is they focus a lot on security and have signon password and account password which is great With the account details page you can view your deposits and your account details . What is upsetting about this bank is you can’t swipe their card everywhere as there are lot of charges coming your way . I have been charged for filling petrol and even when I enetered the visa card on ebay there was a charge of 14 rupees which is ridiculous. Also they have actually improved their website now . I faced issues with their website and was without e-access for months even after writing to their support . Even the branch services are still those monotonous old banks and the customer centric approach not to be found. Also I tried encashing a one time reiumbursement cheque issues by cathay pacific in dollars for damaged baggage and the guy at the bank says I would need to make a bond of 500 rupees for me to get my claim of 6000 in dollars which is absolutely hopeless. Benefits-* Being a nationalized bank has govt support and hence safe Very secure when it comes to e-transactions with added security firewalls available on mostly all the eCommerce websites unlike citibank( private) good number of branches and atm’s compared to bank of Maharashtra Demerits -* customer care and retention nominal bank centric not customer centric approach Lack of tie-ups hence less features offered on the card.
ABPnews,Boring news channel,1,Star news is one of the most worst news channel in the present day.Star news after become the ABP news. The news of this channel is very boring the way they represent news is very poor.The news which they show is sometimes too much fake just for the earning the TRP.The quality of the news  is very poor as compare to the news channel. The host of the ABP news is not very experienced sometimes they unable to express the news in the proper way.They always repeat the news so people gets bore. Today many good news channel is available so it is better to watch that news channel.For earning the money they always show too much advertisements so people gets bore.The quality of the programs  is not up to mark.Sometimes they repeat the same news.ABP news is average news channel.
ABPnews,Not that good,3,"This news channel is not that good and it does not show that much truth about the news and hides a lot of facts about the true news. I have seen them manipulating the true facts and keeping in front us in a way as such they have covered this much. their reporters are quite good but the way they produce the news on the air its really embarrassing. they are definitely associated with some political house and they try to run their agenda through that. I have personally seen their reporters asking blunt questions from a particular party spokesperson. they create a buzz of any useless news and try to gather the attention of audience. their political segment news is their target and they always try to run their agenda through their mindless reporters. sometimes I feel that that they have recruited reporters like neha who are so dumb that they cant even appear unbiased. they are so dumb that they cant even pyt their questions properly, I recommend you not to listen this news channel and move to someone else."
ABPnews,Some Programs are Too Good,4,ABP news channal anchors have good experiance to handle any debate . This channal have many entertaining programs like sas bahu or sajis.i think this channel is probably dedicated to only this program SAS BAHU OR SAJIS. Anchor ABHISAR SHARMA have good knowledge about politics and social activity.Debate on this channel is also wonderful. Anchor handles all the guest very well. The show press confrence have an resolution in all news channels. DEEBANG is also the knowledgeful reporter ever. I really appriciate this channel
ABPnews,Use less debate.,1,According to me. this news channel is not a news channel its like a totally nonsense. I watched this channel many time news is just OK how they are presenting the news but debate is totally useless. mr. deepak chorasiya he man is totally unfit for the debate. when this man anchoring the debate I changed my channel. because. this man ask totally useless questions. maximum time same persons for the debate this channel always interfere in the talk of debate. mr. deepak did not allow to anyone to complete their point. this channel should move on from the deepka chorasiya. the main reson to dislike this channel is deepak chorasiya. never watch this man anchoring.
ABPnews,Not really a news channel,2,It started in collaboration with a foreign firm and became independant a while ago as ABP. Tough very earnest initially its has lost its sheen over the time. Not only has the journalist standard have gone down but also the efficacy has gone low. The debates are more about yelling at each other. News sections are least informative. They miss out on all the important details. Journalism should be unbiased. These people tend to act as social judges for society. The adds seem to run all the while with some news patches  every now and then. And that male anchor who runs around with a mic in hand is annoying. He yells over his throat to make sense ending up making none.
ABPnews,ABP news channel .....Hindi News,5,ABP news channel is the new one to news channel world.I like their news representation Which I like them.Their news quality and new equality method  to all news channels. It's be an a Hindi news channel and just launched some years ago. Its be an a tough competition in the news channel now.but it makes its place. I like its hosts and display news way.Its be different and their  anchors and reporter all done a best way how they can show the incident and how fast the teach destination.Important news bulletin time fatafat news and entertainment time by serial recap all are clear manner .and best time shows . Its be an complete package of all type of news .They can also help the people which is stand against the police and law which can show  people cases which are not give attained by the corrupt. Governanent. I can recommend it to all its be an a best channel .News Topper my way . Thanks
ABPnews,Developing News Channel Of India,4,ABP news channel be now a rising news channel of India. The news channel is come in existence in the year 2014 starting when that is not so much favorite channel. But now its becomes mist popular channel. In previous or its starting time its now its not a good channel fir news. ACHIEVEMENT. Abp news reaches a new height in the end of year almost with the most popularity and ratings and also a competition with the other news channel. WHY I LIKE ABP NEWS CHANNEL is because the debates and their host which I like most to conduct an extra knowledge about the nation . I collect many other general knowledge which help me in the competitive exams. TELECASTING AND REPORTERS. The telecasting and reporting crew members of the abp news are youngsters that's why I like it most the young generation of India help in development of it . NEWS DEBATES AND THEIR TELECASTING TECHNOLOGY The most favorite are debates on the election time occurs on the news channel and also help me to make our vocabulary full of general know ledge. The camera man and their reporting are fabulous how they collected news and show on channel . LANGUAGE. Its an Hindi language news channel and its users and popularity increases day by day. MY OPINION AND EXPERIENCE Acc to my opinion u should try this channel once a time it is suitable for all best .otherwise choice is yours what u like. Thanks
ABPnews,Some what extent ABP is the best.,4,"Various news channels are popular in india. But, ABP channel is something special. I mostly watch and prefer in the time of publication of election results. At that time I can see the whole details of result on the screen. This speciality is my favourite which brings eagerness inside my mind. Nothing in the world is absolute in nature. There are some disadvantages of this channel which bores me a lot. More advitertisements are relayed after a short news time. Debate sessions are boring. In the modern era it is the most valuabe news channel. I apprecite that."
ABPnews,About newd,1,Only pagal news bolane ka koi tamiz nahin hai yah news ko band karo fashion Karke aate kuchh matlab Nahin humko kya sikhana hai kya sikhana hai

ABPnews,Good news channel,5,"When the agreement with the NDTV expired in 2003, STAR News was transformed into a complete Hindi language news channel, part of STAR and ABP tie up.In 2003, the contract with NDTV ended and STAR decided to run the channel on its own. However, the government introduced a guideline capping foreign equity in the News business to 26% . STAR then entered into a JV with The Ananda Bazar Patrika group to form a company called Media Content and Communications Services Pvt. Ltd. ( MCCS) which ran the channel STAR News."

They have the potential to grap their viewers and making them realise the news they are involved in is of their use. The news in my opinion is very good and we all should appreciate the way they are working."

I have recommended  for this channel have the same there to like competitors  like aajtak this channel earlier known star news
ABPnews,"My Favourite Program on ABP News is ""Ramrajya"".",4,"ABP News is my favourite news channel. I like this channel's every program. ABP News is an Indian news channel owned by ABP( Anandabazar Publications) Group. It was earlier known as STAR News and was owned by a joint venture between News Corporation owned STAR TV/Fox International Channels. It's sister channels are ABP Ananda ABP Majha ABP Sanjha I am Bengali so I like to watch ABP Ananda. It's program is also wonderful and totally information related. Some programs are best for me, which are: 25 KHABREIN FATAFAT KHABAR DIN BHAR SANSANI SACCHI GHATANA They are master in investigation of particular news. It's program like Pradhanmantri is wonderful for students. It's all about history and politics. Pradhanmantri( The Prime Minister) is a political documentary series, hosted by actor-director Shekhar Kapur. Another program I like most is Ramrajya. We know about Lord Ram and his state where people was so happy. They had organise this series by visiting many countries for finding the most happiness way of life in various sectors. Below I given some example: Ramrajya - Episode 7: China has Ramrajya in terms of Development and India needs to learn from it. Some might argue that it is difficult to apply corruption free formula or a great metro service of Japan to india which is a larger country. But China has done it. Then why can’t India. The effort to develop by inviting foreign investments helped the Chinese economy a lot. Apart from that, inviting and imbibing technological advancements from abroad was another step. The most important was owning private property. This became the basis of economic development. Ramrajya - Episode 2: Finland's free and equal education for all is a model for India to follow. In the second episode of Ramrajya, Finland’s education system is a perfect example of a system with ramrajya. In Finland education is equal and free for all the students. They are being provided by each and every type of facility to make the education worth enjoying and learning. The dull students are focused upon more. The best part of the Finland’s education was that one teacher is provided till the students reach grade 7. This helps in making a good contact and repo with each and every student. Ramrajya - Episode 3: Denmark is a corruption free country and India needs to follow its footsteps. Ramrajya – Episode 3: Denmark is a corruption free country and India need to follow its footsteps. In Denmark, the government officials do not even accept flowers or chocolates as bribe. Denmark has been ranked as number one in the honest countries list of 2014. My friends you can watch this program on YouTube. This program was my favourite, that's why I wrote about that. Thanks to all."
ABPnews,ABP News popularity .,4,"ABP News channel is a very popular news channel , I think it is more than 10 years old news channel .I like to watch this news channel daily all the reporters and anchors are performing well. The most likable part of that it's  film entertainment gossips are so nice that we can't amazing they showing us live scenes when ever this situation created in our nation most of the important and nice about abp news is that they never breaks there news when they comes live in our home they covers each and every parts of the news so abp news is famous rather than others news channel."
ABPnews,A good News Channel,4,"One of the best news channels in India. I have been watching this news channel since I was a kid its never changed its service its always given its best service to date. First, the name was star new but it changed to ABP new but the name might have changed but the service and the name is still the same nothing has changed it's providing the best new as far as possible and fast too. Recently they launched the app for smartphones so you can download and watch the latest news from anywhere and any time. I also sit at the night to watch FATAFAT which gives the best new in half an hour it covers the news of the entire day so you don't miss out on anything so anyone not watched this news channel go ahead a watch or download the app for free"
ABPnews,Not bad...not good...average,2,"We have freaking 100s of news channels on our tvif we count all international, national English, National Hindi and regional language. It is a cut throat competition out there. In the segment of Hindi news channels since the target audience differs from English news channels.most of the programs are loudly packaged. And stupid issues are raised. ABP News is offcourse one of them. I would rate it the number 2 Hindi channels in the aspects of quality of programs. The number 1 will be NDTV News and number 3 would be AAJ tak( I said this in the context of quality programs) Nowadays news channels doliterally anything to higher their TRPs and earn money. Almost all of them are biased to some or other political party.it is more of'paisa feko, tamasha dekho' trend. In this entire scenario ABP news is average not so good not so bad. Star news was worst.since it has become ABP the quality of the programs is raised. Anchors on this channel are not very good or not ver bad. They fail to impress. So, go for this one if it is fitting into your budget.but if you do not opt for it.honestly it doesn't matter."
ABPnews,Such a farji news channel,2,Abp news is hindi news channel previously known as star news. It is not a good news channel. It not shows the news we needed. Repeat and repeat telecaste comes over the news channel. They only serves glamourous type of news to collect their TRP. When we watch another news channel as compared to this channel we seem to those channel are better than this news channel. When we watch the same news again and again we get bored of that news and finally we have to change the channel. Abp news can't be favourite of viewers due to its weak news presentation techniques. It will be better when tgey try to improve their quality. Please stop to show the other fake type of news and shows what the people wants and need. Don't recommend this channel to viewers.
ABPnews,Best news channel,4,"ABP news channel is one of the best news channel. News broadcast in this channel is very informative. Features of this news channel are:- it has great reporters, full disclosure of every news, news headlines, camera effects are also good. etc. ABP news means AAPKO RAKHE SABSE AAGE.  all shows shown in this channel is very good but my favourite one is Saas Bahu aur Saazish. This serial is about latest update of serials shows on different channel, upcoming news about serial, twist and turn of serials, TRP reports, etc. It is aired on Mon to Sun @ 2:30 PM. I love this serial. It is one of my favourite channel."
ABPnews,Best news channel,4,"Dear readers, my reviews on India’s no.1 News Channel “ABP News”. It is the best in these days because they are very quick in getting the news around the globe and present it to the viewers with precise correct information. Another similar channel is “Aaj Tak” but they are a bit slower in getting the news and they are more in boasting about their channel. The anchors and the editors of this channel are working very hard which can be seen with the quality of news they provide in very short time period. Their on field reporters are also very formative with their sources very trust worthy. This channel has the maximum number of on field reporters than any other channel. The only bad thing about this channel is that they have very long commercial breaks very regularly. They should definitely cut short this time period.There are many other competitive channels like “Aaj Tak”, “Zee news”, “Ibn 7”."
ABPnews,Political news,3,Abp news is previously known as star news. It is one of the leading news channel of media they have good and experienced reporters with a panel of experts. I like the reporting style of kishore ajwani and shrivardhan trivedi but there is one concern with this channel is that It hikes political issues majorly. The evening shows are full of live debate and most of the time they have a political agenda. They are concentrate on political news more and other issues less as india is a very big country issues of every part should be discussed in national news. Abp news is also available in app available in play store apple store and for windows mobile. Abp news has a large network of reporters and they provide news very fast. Many times I saw any issues are first reported by abp news
ABPnews,ABP news,4,"Star news now it is known as ABP news. ABP news is an indian news channel owned by ABP group. It was launched in February 1998. There are many sister's channel of ABP news which are ABP Sanjha, ABP Ananda and ABP Majha. The full form of ABP is Anandabazar patrika. The ABP news keep us up to date it shows all the national, religional, world and local news. They show image or video footage of anything wrong which  is happening around the world. I love to watch this channel as it is really good. It gives us correct information of everything like crime,  elections,  terrorism and many more. It provides a news bulletins which I love to watch it gaves the short information of every thing which we are not able to watch the whole day. The tone and way the of presenting the news is really good. There are two anchors who present ghe news which is reported by the reporters. News related  to traffic, entertainment, meteorologist and weather is also shown on this channel."
ABPnews,They are killing the purpose of news,1,I believe the purpose of news should be just informing people and not creating 'strong' opinions. I have been following all major news channels in India and I found all of them have their strong opinions and they are just trying to prove what they think is right. All this is story with all news channel and star is on the top. All it does is it is trying to'sell' news rather than impart news. After lot of research I found two news channel aÂ lot lot lot better that is Lok Sabha TV. Rajya Sabha TV. They are the best according to me
ABPnews,A garbage called Star News.... huh...,1,"I really feel ashamed after watching star news.What a crap they shows on TV. They try to put their agenda in the mouth of interviewer. They always try to put ""masala"" on normal news with sounds/music(bollywood songs . give me a break). Their news headline does not have a head not a line.They thought by putting a White text on Red banner will make their POS attractive. They have a pathetic news section called as ""wah cricket"". Looks like they spend whole of their life in getting a glimpse of a cricketer and then show the same shot 100 times in a 2 min news with their BS commentry copupled with bollywood music and sounds . They don't understand their social responsibility and run after cheap news and add masala's . If you look at their news reporter voice seems as if they are going to fight.Shouting at top of your voice does not make a news worth watching. I will keep Zee news/Aaj TAk/India news in the same sh*t category. Really they don't deserve to be a channel at all.Really frustrating."
ABPnews,Pioneering the Pathetic Indian Media.,1,"When we were all kids our english teachers taught us how to write articles and news reports. I know its in the CBSE syllabus. But I was always taught that ""the news"" is and HAS TO BE impartial. Star news is something like a pathetic soap opera when you compare it to the news channels like BBC or CNN. This is not because Indian news agencies are not good its because the news in india has become nothing less than a top comercial object. They show what sells. But trust me most of it is glamorised stories!. While Star fancies itself(like all other news channels) to be the best. It claims to keep you ahead. ""Aaap ko rakhe aage"" But what it does is quite the opposite. It airs many programs like ""Sansani"" and special reports about ""Kiski kaar kiske upar"" or ""Who is the father of some heroin's son"" They ussually deprive the general public of what they need to know. Apart from depriving the public of what they need to know the indian media is also playing top role in destroying the nations harmony. Consider the recent riots between veena's and gujjars in Rajasthan, a responsible news channel shall stick to facts and say something like ""The violence in rajasthan escalates as the communities clash, these many people are dead. these trains are cancelled. these many people are stranded for these many days"" But The commercial news channels will show repititive footage of ""isolated incidents"" and make a story as if the entire state is in complete mayhem and say something like ""What the damn is the government doing"" I just cannot explain the disgrace the ""Commercial news channels"" are to the nation. Guys lets dump these channels and stifl to DD news which atleast shows impartial news and not makes issue of small incidents. Also I hate the way 5 full days the channel was airing MR. Bacchans wedding while there were other important things happening. Disgusting"
ABPnews,Feed Back for Sratnews.,5,"Mouthshut .com teams for giving me this oppurtunity  to say  Something regarding our Media Parteners and allow me to share my thought among myn all Friends and Viewers. I, ve chosen STAR  NEWS, as my Mostly worth News Channel and the whole Star Network. Why Starnews Becoz Long back Some where around a era started of TRP in year 99-2000. With the Starting of KBC, Kahanni, Kyunki, all three in a line to tap Viewers from 9 to 11  was not a joke at tht time when media was not much into picture the concept of Trp Came into Existence and hence followed by all and the competiton followed on. Lot many Mrkt Research and Data Mining had been done at that time  but ""Creativity Comes along with Innovation"". Very much thanks to CEO, Mrs Kapoor, Miss Kapoor, Mr. Bachchan and all teams of Star News. Subh Savere, News at 8, 10, Sansani all are the serials which give us many information to us  which ultimately helps us regarding daily GK.

Hope I had covered all my points what Im wanted to Sayor to give in form of Feedback  bcoz it is the way to improve more about it."
ABPnews,News with Zeal,3,"As we know that the news channel play the key role for showing the right image of the country in every sector. like Sports, Politics, Economy, Socity, events etc. This is the Mirror for understanding the secniorio whta's going in country and whta is the future plan. the star news is the really very Productive and trust worthy chennl. it have the zeal in produce news.and try to present in the effective manner so that every body can understand the actual condition. not emphasis such matter that can be raise.and alwasy try to raise over voice in every issue.and generalized the news. specailly the some of the special programme that arrange by star news.that's really teriffic. and about anchoring they present very good way.and the range of the any specifc news depend upon the priority of the news.this is one of the good plan of the star news. so this is really a good nesw channel"
ABPnews,Aapko paagal karw,1,"If you are still wondering at the title of my review well then let me explain to you that is my takeoff on star news channels catchline as it precisely does the same as in mentioned in the title.the news channels in the years gone by were supposed to provide the best news on sensitive and important national  and local issues and maybe sports but as you must have noticed everything in india  is undergoing changes and news channels are no different as trpisation of news have  occured and channels themselves have become theatre of absurd and leading the pack according to me in this case is definately star news star news according to me is the worst news channel according to me but hold on arent we getting the defination of the channel as it is mostly a tv taboloid if one owere to look at the programmes on it  recently as most of programmes are on tv and film stars  with certain film pairs impending marriage in varanasi being their centre point garnished by round the clock reporting.it airs all  the news it can get hands on without verifying the facts which in recent times really include bizzare ones like a person predicting his own death beforehand,prince rescue drama which according to me was nothing more than a child falling in a ditch and rahul mahajan  wife beating case and its programmes are  more horrifying with title that suggest of cheap erotic hindi novels rather than a news programme like mauth kuvapatni ki shaddish and many others which I cant remember but wht takes the cake or my nerves is the programme sansani which is hosted by a long haired person who himself seems to have served a jail term is the worst with all those local murders being glorified  and earm piercing baritone of the anchors.star news today has become a set up avenue for those seeking two minutes of fame legally or illegally .i also think that the stnews has also taken the wind out of once revolutionary term breaking news with it putting irrelevant and sundry items under breaking news . ithink if you are looking for serious news avoid this channel"
ABPnews,Sansani: Jaago...Sone waalon!!,3,"Long ago...once upon a time...when TV was synonymous with DD and magazines ruled the roost, there used to be one by the name of ""Manohar Kahaniyaan"". It had stories about crime - brothers killing each other over property disputes, thefts, loots, homicides, kidnappings, rapes and all other kinds of heinous crimes...With pictures of victims and suspects scattered, the actual report was made as sensational as possible. Result: People gulped down every bit of it and I must say it was among the pioneers of current reality shows on TV albeit in a printed format. True - a reality show with people committing crimes isnt possible. So what do you have instead? A surrogate reality show! Yes. Where you have ""natya rupantaran"" or dramatised version of the events. Its always one's ultimate dream (or nightmare! as you take it) to be at the scene of crime.  ""Where were you on that fateful night of 22 November,2002?"" (Ummm..aaa.. I was..aaa..I guess I was sleeping mi-lord!) Alibis, hostile witnesses, false convictions, long running cases - all these have two sides to them. ONE - the partcipants - the victim, the criminal, accomplices, witnesses, circumstantial evidence..and TWO - the speculators. Then you have the third and the most important ones - the police,the detectives,the judciary on whom rests the onus of solving the mystery. And finally, you have the reporters. In the days of print media it was  ""Manohar Kahaniyaan"". Cut to today, when  we have  dozens of  News  Channels, its  SANSANI!! Star News' Sansani is a crime show aired Mon - Fri 11 pm. Produced by B.A.G Films, this show has just completed two years a couple of weeks ago. Its USP is its star host - Shrivardhan Trivedi whose get up suggests that he is released by Tihar Jail for two hours every day to host the show.  ""Chain se sona hai to jaag jayiye!!!!!!!"" - screams Shrivardhan with his typical twist of hands. His entry on the show would put the bollywood heroes to shame. If you are preparing to watch this show, make sure you put your kids to sleep, your wife to sleep if you have one, close all windows and doors, get a bottle of water, lower the volume of your television set(don't worry, Shrivardhan speaks loud enough for you to hear clearly) and then carefully seat yourself in front of your Television set. Don't get too close to the screen when the voice over says : ""Zara gaur se dekhiye is masoom chehre ko."" (Watch this innocent face carefully). As the drama unfolds, you shudder and thank god it ain't you. But when you realise how grievous and incredible the world of crime can be, you just can't relax and go to sleep. Thats what the show aims at. To make you aware, alert and know the importance of being the part of the society and not just the part of your own small family. Sansani has been instrumental in helping the law in catching the suspects, making long losts meet - all through its helpline mobile number and email constantly scrolling or splashed on the screen while the hour long show is on. I won't mind a dose of reality if that reality really helps people in their day to day lives. Shrivardhan may seem overtly dramatic but that is also a part of his and producers' sincerity as people cannot be woken up from sleep in whispers. They have to be screamed at! There have been several such shows in the past on different channels. In the past, Suhaib Iliyasi's India's Most wanted was one such show. There is another on IBN where a lady seems to be teaching witchcraft rather than reporting a crime. Sansani is an immensely popular show and though I donot watch it religiously, I am always hooked when I happen to be awake and surfing channels at night. Kudos to the team of SSSANNNNNNSANNiiiiiiii !!  NOTE: I COULD NOT FIND THE APPROPRIATE CATEGORY. Was itching to post a review after a long time so did not even wait to request the right category ;)"
ABPnews,Negligence towards naxalite attacks,3,"This is to inform the news reporters n star management that apart frm showing prince's story n bombay blast even chhattisgarh naxalite attack was important to cover but its so sad that poor aadivasis from naxalite scared places r being killed every alternate day n they get nothing except pains n sorrows.iwhen u can gift 5 lacs to prince y cnt u pay poor adivasisat least 25000 rs for their pains.35 poor people were killed n news was as small as a running advertizement on the screen.i think u people r only concerned with ur trp and dnt bother for poor naxalite 'pidit' people at all. when bombay blast is important, bus drowned in sonipat was important chattisgarh naxalite attack was important either but poor people get nothing or this may be the case when u r concerned only to money. one more thing girls caught in prime ministers if they give the explaination that they just were concerned that the security arrangements r good for our pm or not because a common man is as it is without security for life they face terrorist danger al the time. whta were spg guards doing? they could have returned them immediatly or arrested. but its very shameful that our primeministers security  n life is as simillar to us,a normal common man."
ABPnews,Headache,1,"Mostly I like to watch news channels on television at evening time. I have many times saw the news briefing and headlines on Star News. Apart from Pol Khol none of the serials and news are watchable. Frankly speaking you will get headache when you start watching star news. Mostly if you see other channels like India TV, NDTV, and Zee News, they have short description of a particular topic but they cover the entire issue in that. Where else I have seen Star News where the issue is very small but they can show that for 2 hours just fo nothing. I think star news dont have many issues to cover up thats why they stick to one news and try to stretch it to 1 - 2 hours. I have seens the host of the star news. it seems they are forced to tell more on the topic, all though nothing is left to tell abt the same. And you can notice the Commercial Break Frequency in this channel, its every 5 minutes. Oh God - it really a head ache!!! I saw the 26/6 news on all the channels. In that the Star News reporter was standing at Andheri after 2 days of the 26/6 flood. There was just 1/2 feet of water which was stable for round about 4 - 5 hours but the news reporter was giving the news in such a way that now the area will get flood. I think the reporter was stupid wasting her  4 - 5 hours giving the news about that 1/2 feet of water. Instead she should have come to chembur where there was still 3 feet water even after 2 days. Star News is the most boring news channel of all. Kindly dont waste your time watching it. If you really want to watch I will recommend three news channels which is not boring and up to the point. First is India TV with Rajat Sharma (everybody know Rajat Sharma how he delivers the news and take interviews) Second is Zee News which gives news from each and every corner of India and lastly NDTV."
ABPnews,Are they truly unbiased,1,"The way STAR news is presenting his news made me write this.  There handling the issue of   Shri SANKARACHARYA'S ARREST was much to admired and followed. STAR NEWS from the day one started to plant stories on Sankaracharya.  Read yourself how often they are changing a. They started the ransom with 15lakhs and now it has reached more than one crore. b. They were the first to leak information about Sankaracharya's acceptance in the role of murder which was also not proved yet. c. They were to leak information about Sankaracharya given statement praising Jayalalitha as the Kamakshi devi which was also not proved yet. d. They spoke so much about USHA and now they are changing there version on this. e. They took interview with Anuradha ramanan for a lengthy time.  I wish to state only 10 months back at the opening of Child trust hospital she has thanked Acharya for being the cause for her cure in her distress time.  This has come in all magazines. f. They were the first to say 10 days back that Appu surrendered at Chittor.  Eventually he did surrender their.  How do they get information which is not available with Tamilnadu police. We can go on discuss many factors of the way in which they creat perception and kill a personality image.  Since, the case in the highest court I wish not to go on the speculation war on which STAR NEWS IS RELYING ON. Instead going into the pros and cons of the case they are involving only in the perception campaign and character assassination on one of the tallest leader of Hindu religion.  Hope they will come to terms with their style and start giving true news instead of giving news by the name of moving ahead and fastest."
ABPnews,Red Alert - An Adventurous step by Star news ,5,"Just happened to see the red alert program run by Star News. It was about call girl business running in Delhi and now in Mumbai. And I was surprised by the facts shown by the show. It is very appreciating effort by star news to bring out the reality of so called actress and models who sell their body for some bucks. And also feel pity that for instant money what all people tend to do? Are human needs so high, that one has to sell the body? The risk involved in tracing the dalals and talking to the models and capturing them in hidden cameras and all this without revealing own identity is the tough and risky job !! For all this red alert team deserves a pat on the back!! I was astonished by the network of dalals and their concern about security and cautiousness about the deal. By all means Red Alert deserves cheers for great job!! Keep it up !!"
ABPnews,Not being able to match the expectations,3,"STAR NEWS  has  a  large  void  to  fill until  it  can  be  compared  with  other  be  it  NDTV, Aaj  Tak  or  even  our  DD. If we have to analyse each of this  news  broadcasters then we would understand each  of  them  have  their  followers.  NDTV caters to Higher middle income to up market viewers, who thinks NDTV is demi-god in this field but have to understand that good team and people can do wonders Aaj Tak  is  typical  Hindi  belt  channel. The news are like reading some B grade news paper in terms  of  content. The viewer are typical large uneducated population and thus the news content have to explain in detail about the event and its background. The channel continues to be same ofr all it major news. Consistency thus is key. DD  refuses to improve except of newsreader wearing  check shirts with designer tie. what a  match. Only DD would give such sight and surprisingly it continues doing so makes me wonder that does any senior DD staff  watches the news themself or not. STAR NEWS unfortunately  would  be  always  compared  with  erstwhile star news managed by NDTV team. Star news have good reach and really hardworking team who want to put their best and stamp their identity but erasing old image is very difficult. I know no one should be compared and they all do their best but when we all are in same league, comparision becomes inevitable. Star news have started well but have lot to do before it can be recognized  on  it  own.  I wish the day comes fast"
ABPnews,Not upto the mark,1,"With all the monies available to them Star News is a let down for an avid news-watcher. The channel with all its good intentions lands up in its own mess a number of times during any given day. First and foremost the biggest problem with this channel is trumpeting about itself on its own airtime. I thought the painfully loooooong and boring self promotional ads are only limited to few early days after launch. But they keep on repeating them and now people are sick of them. They take too many breaks and I suspect that their break-time is longer than the actual newscast time. The problem is I have no other choice and have to watch them to keep in touch with India. You switch to it and they are having a break. They read one news story and they have a break. They read headlines and they take a break. And every time the same nauseating repetition of calling themselves the best. For God's sake please leave the decision to the viewers. Your ratings will tell whether you are good or not. The news coverage is quite amateurish especially the exchange between the newscaster and the reporter on site. The questions asked by newscasters to the reporters are repetetive, childish, prejudiced and full of assumptions. The replies are equally pathetic. Technically they are the worst. The captions do not match with the news. Either they run early or late. Newsflashes overcast the caption of running programme. Also they re-run the so-called ''LIVE'' news bulletins. You can catch them if you follow a Cricket Match or Election results, most of the times they are two to three hours behind the actual happenings. I will jump to any other Indian Live News Channel the day I have a choice."
ABPnews,Still having good presence,2,Star news is still having good presence in news channels despite having tough cometition by other news channels like aaj tak ndtv sahara samay like that its strenght is it is pioneer in 24 hour news channels in india and having good analitical corrosspance and nice interviews. but they have to go miles ahead if they want to be in the race for the no 1 channel because taste of viewers is changin and they have to change themselves for that. there programs like big fight was quite famous. they have to cover more entertainment news and political discoveries if they want to be in the race. but still they are doing good work and they should add more new correspondance and news reader if they want to add something fresh in their news channels.they should add more hindi news time for hindi news viewers one can competie the star news with aaj tak and sahara samaya . nowadays dd 2 news is also giving stiff competition to them they should try to make it free to air channel also
ABPnews,Better than Others,5,"I have been watching Star news for quite sometime on continous basis. I found it best compared to other news channel. The best program I found so far is everyday's 'Newshour' at 10 pm. It gives you complete day stories ranging from Politics, Sports, Bollywood etc. And the best part they invite people from all the concerned parties in the studio and try to get into the depth of the topic. It is at best when 'Rajdeep Sardesai' and his companion debates with personalities. Also other programs like 'Big Fight' is worth watching. Apart from this the morning 'Breakfast News' is also good as they cover the main headlines and stories quickly and you don't see too many ads in the break. Atleast this 30 minutes gives you an insight of all the things happened overnight. The host are definately above average especially of English News. One more thing: If you also look at the advertisements during the breaks it is of better quality compared to the ads in other news channel. Though 'Aaj Tak' goes into detail of the major stories, sometime you tend to be restless and found boring. Other channels are 'Zee News' and 'Jain TV' which are not worth mentioning."
ABPnews,Newsroom? Courtroom!!,3," Looks like I'm in the company of Star News fans :) A long time ago there was 'The World this Week' where Parannoy Roy reported and hooked us all. Then came the satellite TV glut and Roy got his 24 hour dream! Star News was an awesome change from the state run DD news bulletins - and the anchor persons surely smarter than the ones on DD. Soon everyone was watching Star News. Parannoy expanded and a whole bunch of new faces appeared. And with them came Rajdeep Sardesai! Star News does have a wide variety of programmes. But the main issue is Sardesai and the others who're adopting his style of news-reading - if you can call it that. Its not news anymore - not just reporting facts and insights into them - but forming public opinions - fairness be damned. Its about the media deciding things and passing judgement. They do not let their guests have a last say. They try digging out a controversy out of the most uncontroversial issues and very often put words in their guests' mouths - which is very very unfair. Rajdeep goes to the extent of quoting his guests out of context immediately after they've spoken by interjecting (rather rudely) with ''so you're saying....'' and putting a completely different spin on the words. If a guy's done good work - its 'so the govt is not helping you with this' even if that was the last thing on the person's agenda and he had no cribs before Star News caused the seeds of one. News persons should never pass judgement. Rajdeep and his gang should not try and become representatives of a country but should merely report what they see and the background for the stories. Responsible stories can happen if you do not get your personal biases into them. Barkha Dutt is one bright spot in the team. Srinivasan too. Unfortunately, the rest of the team are Sardesai clones - almost. Parannoy Roy should look beyond the ratings now."
ABPnews,Star News or NDTV,4,"Those who hve followed Star News for its beginning will surely say that Star hve lost its momentum. and with news that the NDTV & Star contract will not be renewed and Roy is trying to start his own news channel , we may be just witnessing the fall of INDIAN VOICE which was heard Internationally. One thing Star News Had agained proved that 'we Indians rise to a occasion very quickly and fall with the same speed ''NDTV team quickly responded to the opportunity but had failed to keep the expection of the Indians up to that mark specially in current year.due to which many Indians turn towards aaj tak and zee news , of which aaj tak succesfully took the best news channel award two times in a row, but what mainly is effected in the INDIAN VOICE which was heard Internationally."
ABPnews,Not so good,1,"Star News, gets its news content and programming from the NDTV company,with whom Star had signed a 5 year contract. Star News started out as the premier English news channel in India, however, all good things must come to an end. I donot wish to go into politics and other swampy areas to justify the bad rating, so take the example of the Indian Air Force and its MiG crashes, instead of investigating the crashes and the reasons behind them, like Ministry of Defence delays, etc, they opt for sensationalism like (sorry to say) small town rags. Their presenters seem quite ok, but their reporters seem to always always point out the negatives in a piece of news. I concede that the media's role is that of a watchdog, but manner in which they report, it seems that India a foul, bad place to live in, which by all accounts it is not. I would ask them, if they read ms.com that they please try and be a little more like http://www.goodnewsindia.com ! Their programmes like We the People are some of the better programmes on TV today, however it's a pity that it comes once a week that too on a sunday."
ABPnews,I beg to differ......,3,"As I go through the reviews written by many of my friends in MS about STAR News, I beg to differ on some counts. May be, my views are different because I missed the STAR coverage during Afganisthan (as mentioned by many). However, as I have seen STAR coverage recently I have following observations.. Selective Coverage STAR, while covering certain incidents to the depth, manages to MISS similar incidents elsewhere in India. For instance, starvation deaths in Rajasthan & Maharashtra, mass exodus from Madhya Pradesh, Law & order in Bihar & Bengal were inadequately covered. While petrol pump scam, affecting a few influential pump owners and a large corporate got WIDE coverage, Co-operative banks' scam affecting millions of ORDINARY people in Maharashtra was virtually untouched. Managed Debates The debates on STAR, often appear to be MANAGED. The choice of participants is, many times not correct. Of the three parties, neutral party is seldom not neutral and the ability and knowledge of two factions does not match. Fielding second rung BJP functionary against Kapil Sibal or similar one from congress against Arun Jaitly makes the debates lop sided. The refrees, who are supposed to be like judges, often express their opinions rather than comment on the relative merits of the arguments. Interruptions, while the speaker is speaking are seldom controlled by anchors. Rather, it is left to the ability of speaker to interrupt or to prevent interruption. So the more vocal speakers MANAGE to get more time. News as whole This does not mean than STAR news is not worth watching. It is the only English news channel based in India and hence, occupies a place. But as mentioned by some others in MS, morning reruns of News is too bad. While other news channels transmit fresh news, STAR keeps us abreast with last evening's news. I hope STAR improves on these counts and proceeds to make it a complete news channel."
ABPnews,Hello and welcome to the pride of India,5,"In a newspaper article Rajdeep Sardesai,the political editor of Star news said that he is not very comfortable before the Camera.But according to my observations during the last three years one thing I can confidently say is he is ONE OF THE BEST TV JOURNALIST OF NOT ONLY INDIA BUT AROUND THE GLOBE. My association with the star news  as I said earlier is atleast 3 years old.It is my favourite news channel and rajdeep Sardesai and Burkha Dutt are my favourite TV  Journalists.In fact these two journalists are themselves institutions of journalism.Their quest for the truth and the way they get the things from the horse's mouth if just unique.Both Rajdeep and Barkha show great commitment and involvement in their assignments. Who can forget Barkha's reporting from Kargil and rajdeep's adventure in Gujarat?Sadly instead of appreciating for their commendable job some political elements are wrongly accusing them of bad reporting! Arnab Goswami is anohter amicable anchor who has a beautiful way of taking along the discussion.Sreenivasan Jain,Sonali verma,Vishno som,Nalin mehta,Vikram Chandra are some other important journalists who have contributed to the success of Starnews."
ABPnews,'star' news,3,"Every once in a while, we come across examples of the media playing a role bigger than itself. they take it upon themselves to 'mould' public opinion, confident that they are 'always right' and it is upto them to 'show' us the world. THROUGH THEIR EYES. star news is one such example. this is one of the few channels where we find newscasters busy trying to push their opinions and giving personal comments on news. they always 'have to' give us more than the news. gimme a break! and gimme just the news. I can form my own opinions, thank you! precisely why I stopped watching star news. added later : ok looks like some of the readers have a problem with my opinions. lemme clarify. watch the bbc(just an example). there are newscasts. then there are news analyses. there are opinion programs also. very different from each other. from what I have watched of star news (of course, like I said, I haven't been watching it for a while now) I get the feeling that these diverse programming genres are a li'l mixed, as in all rolled into one. that in my opinion that will drive the viewer to form opinions on credibility. like, do they really tell you how qualified they are as to form political opinions or whatever? are they the 'intelligentsia' that we have to look up to? of course, they are smart, savvy newscasters. my point was that there needs to be distinction between programming genres. I need the news. keep the opinions separate. period."
ABPnews,The Star is Forever News,4,"The name is News. Star News. Well, what more can one say about this news channel, other than accepting the fact that it bonds really well. With US, Indians. Keep the rumours burning. The Star News is On! NDTV is one of the best things to have happened to Modern India. First it was The World This Week and then the Star News. Prannoy Roy, the man-in-charge is a visionary in every sense of the word. He saw the relevance of 'News'. Someone who believed in the word Infotainment when many clung to age-old perceptions of dissemination of Information. Hats off to you sir! Now, Roy keeps himself hidden strategically and makes an occasional appearance. Instead, he has etched the presence of a dynamic brand of journalists who are fearless, hungry for The Truth and sensitive to the deprived. The names of Rajdeep Sardesai and Barkha Dutt emerge prominently in the list of brightest News Faces in this country. Their brand of journalism makes you feel proud of being an Indian. Somewhere it makes you feel secure. All's not unwell. All can't be unwell. The Hope Lies Eternal In Human Breast! Amongst the shows that really make my day, then NewsHour on weekdays between 10-11 is my favourite. I simply love to absorb the juicy news stories of the day, the round of bouting between the warring politicians or their likes and the dessert in the shape of celestial bodies from the Celebrity World. There are other shows like News at 7, Hot Line, News at 11 and more. There's Bollywood News at 6:30, hosted by Samar Khan which also endears to me on the days that I catch up with it. I also like Vir Sanghvi hosted Star Talk on Sundays. Mr Sanghvi has a knack for getting the celebrities do the talking and that too effortlessly. He isn't aggressive, niether too flattering, listens genuinely and effectively deals with the difficult questions. He is one of the finest celebrity show hosts I know. All in all, Star News is truly a special channel, though I do have a few apprehensions as to how far it will last. For the Star Management is planning some major changes in the News Programming from the next year. There are also rumours that NDTV is planning a separate channel of its own. Well, till all this is confirmed, I shall continue savouring my evening dinner with my family. And Star News. Star News, For News Connects People!"
ABPnews,And you are watching … Star News !!!,5,"Rajan Mahan , Star News , this is Divya Malik Lahiri , Star News , Ajai Shukla and Vishnu Som reporting from Afghanistan Star news !!! , all household names now, they were just ordinary people like you and me , now they are our personal news bearers. New Delhi Television or NDTV has come a long way !!!. Spearheaded by the suave Prannoy Roy , they have revolutionized Television News reporting in India. I remember the Doordarshan days ,the drab news which we used to get , the News readers were  good though !!! , but it was the lack of quality and the monotony of the news reporting that weighed them down, & I guess they still havent improved either. I remember when Prannoy actually started his brand of news in Doordarshan itself , one of my uncles had remarked '' The way sponsorships are going these days , I guess News is the only thing left and that would be sponsored too.. very soon '' , wasn't he right !!! But then commercials however irritating they may be are the ones can allow producers the financial power to try out new ideas. Star News now is a complete channel on its own, earlier it was a part of the Star plus channel after it split with Doordarshan. NDTV then had the 9 pm slot and the 7 to 9 am slot in the morning with Good Morning India in Star plus and Star World , slowly as the viewer ship increased the Star News Channel was born !!! What makes it Tick ? The presentation , the style , the multilingual approach .. to name a few. There are many news channels now, which air news with their brand of Hinglish !!! ( a mix of Hindi and English ) , I personally find that stupid, because you are getting nowhere, neither are you capturing  the hard core English news viewer nor are you reaching to the masses.. Having a news bulletin in Hindi and also in English makes sure you appeal to both the sections. Their fresh approach in designing new news based programmes, like '' The Big Fight '' by the inimitable and the brilliant Rajdeep Sardesai, and ''Reality Bites'' and ''We the People'' by the modern day Jhansi ki Rani Barkha Dutt. These programs are technically very sound and are very well anchored. Sometimes Rajdeep does a better show in controlling the Politicians than the Speaker of the Lok Sabha !!!. The fearless team of Journalists who rush to the news spot immediately ''As it happens when it happens '' make sure we get our cup of news first and the intelligent discussions by (generally) Vikram Chandra , Prannoy Roy &  Arnab Gosami  on the ongoing topic keeps us glued to our seats. The Business news analysis, Sports analysis , their Limelight segment all make sure that the viewer gets all the information he or she needs. My personally favorite is the bloopers which they air on New year , which shows all the top news readers making small mistakes and sometimes even pulling each others legs !!! Flipsides I am an early riser and I always like to get my cup of news first up, but till 7 am all we get is reruns, of the earlier day's news, this means we don't have the 24 hr ''news'' channel. The fresh news comes pouring only at 7 am. Now that's a tad sad, news is one thing that people would like to see at all times, probably the 7 am can be preponed to 6 am or something… Well so wrapping it up , I must fill your ears with a news article which says NDTV is splitting up with STAR network and in all probability starting their own , Well I will surely miss them during the period between the split off and the launch of the new channel as I cant bring myself to see any other Indian news channel than Star News !!!"
ABPnews,Star Performer,5,"Star News come to symbolize what a good news channel ought to be. And most importantly is the fact that professionalism is apparent in each aspect of the channels programmes. I love the anchors and their style on air. And I feel at home with the language used in its programmes. The information content is excellent and presentation sets high standards. Unlike other channels it does not have huge interruptions in the form of commercial breaks which never seems to end. The backdrop and lighting spells of good taste and the graphics used is very user friendly. My father is an avid fan of this channel (like me. And though we have a choice of most of the news channels on air in India we invariably watch this channel. However, I would prefer a better stylist for the anchors."
ABPnews,Relying On Experience...,5,"Growing up as I did fed on a insipid fare called television dished out by DoorDarshan I guess any other TV channel would have found my fancy easily. But thats not the reason why I have gotten addicted to Star News. When Star actually came up with a 24 hour News Channel, I was very sceptic about it and its possible future...another channel thats going to go away faster than it starts, was my thinking. BBC was at that time, my preferred news channel,though I was very upset whenever they showed the Indian Map without a part of Kashmir in it. I had loved the analytical methods of Pranoy Roy and Vinod Dua when they came up with their election analysis on DD, also Pranoy had that lazy charm or magnetism when he anchored the World this Week. Probably that was what made me tune into Star News initially. Boy was I in store for a surprise. My honest reaction was ''is this really news Iam watching''. As they themselves put it Star delivers more than just NEWS, they analyse it, dissect it and probably present it with the least bias that I have seen. A couple of awards confirmed Star News as not just the best Indian News channel but the best Asian News Network. The newscasters on Star are no lesser than Stars by their own right. Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai, Arnab Goswami, Sreenivasan Jain, Sonia Verma, Sonali, Vikram Chandra to name a few and not to mention the incomparable Pranoy Roy are household names today in urban India atleast. Their election and budget specials current on air is one of the very best. The regular news based shows like Reality Bites, We the people and the Big Fight are simply superb. So are the segments like Star talk, Star Business Week and Breakfast Newsare also excellent. But the two programmes I really hate missing are the NewsHour ( 10 pm weekdays) and Star Sunday ( 9 pm Sundays). Well I guess my wife hates this because it clashes with, Ghar Ghar and Kyunki...but this is one place where she does not get any concessions from me...I learn from news papers that Star News is next only to Aaj Tak in TRP ratings for an Indian News Channel. Aaj Tak probably walks away with its honours due to a greater viewership in the northern part of India. There was a brief time, that my cable operator refused to carry Star News and I had to be content with watching Aaj Tak ( which is not a bad news channel by any stretch of imagination) but I was really thrilled when I started to get Star News again."
ABPnews,Admirable,5,"While I hold no brief for Star News or for any of its anchors, staff, reporters, or whatever you call them, I find that the review does not help the members of this site or for that matter the Star News and its viewers. Most of the issues raised in the review are a digression into the irrelevant and irrational. I wonder if the reviewer has any personal score to settle with Star News and its staff. In which case the review amounts to misusing this site. Having said this, let me present my own views on Star News. This is probably the only Channel (in English) which I watch regularly. I find the whole lot of the staff appearing for presentation highly professional, patient, and articulate. Whether a particular person smiles, stammers, or not, is not central to news presentation. We have to assess the Channel in terms of its coverage, depth and reliability of the coverage and its scope and sweep. In all these Star News deserves all the stars that one can provide as credit rating. I cannot imagine any other Channel having reporters reporting from hazardous situations and in freezing temperature as during the Kargil conflict, and more recently from Afghanistan, and engaging top Army  personnel to explain  the events from their perspective (which is certainly very important). If the staff are aggressive with some of those whom they interview, I am really proud of them. For, in a country like India where the politicians and their hangers-on hold sway, and go about with the feeling that no one can question them, what the Star News staff do is real grilling. Please remember this is done in full public gaze which is bound to humble these persons and have a sobering and civilising effect on them. The way the staff moderate the discussions, occasionally cutting some to size, is really amazing. And all this is done within the constraints of the limited time (does this sound tautological?), and with clockwise precision. Persons like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Amar Singh (I like  his street-smartness) and Laloo Prasad Yadav are like unleashed (what?). Handling them in discussions is like bringing back to the (what?). Making a Murli Manohar Joshi, causing havoc to education and culture in the country, sit like a school boy and answer unpalatable questions is doing the impossible. I can lengthen the list, but I hope readers would have already got the drift of what I have been trying to convey. My only problem with Star News is seeing the same faces of the informed persons, like Sekhar Gupta, Sitaram Yechury and Prakash Karat, most of them time. But we should remember that the show is in Delhi, and as informed persons are not sold on pavements or anywhere else as commodities, getting them  on a day to day basis is difficult. I may have differences with what they say.I may not like the shape of one's nose, the shape of one's head, the style of one's moustachio and so on. But these are not criteria for judging the performance of a busy and well endowed Channel in a large, diverse and complex country like India. I do feel that in all fairness to the Star News and to the MS the reviewer should withdraw the review. PS: BOWING TO THE WISHES OF OTHER MEMBERS I WITHDRAW THE ABOVE SENTENCE. IN FACT, WHETHER WHAT WAS EXPRESSED IS REALLY IN THE REALM OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, AND WHETHER THE REVIEWER HAS TRANSGRESSED THE LIMITS ARE MATTERS FOR THE MS TEAM TO DECIDE. I REGRET FOR HAVING STEPPED INTO THEIR SHOES."
ABPnews,INDIA''S INTERNATIONAL VOICE,3,"” Information is the essence for once Intellectual growth…” During the early part of the Indian Television as in the worldview, we had only on window which was said to be the DOORDARSHAN, whether you take the name by its actual meaning or the reality of Indian television. With the Invasion of Cable Television, we have never looked back and the traditional couch potatoes became actually tuned to the Baywatches, The X-files and many more such serials. Speaking of NEWS, to be very frank, Doordarshan always did a great job with amazing content and the Newscaster at their best. Though people thought NEWS on DD was not that great but believe me guys today’s News Channels apart from BBC, none of them are concerned about the news. During DD days, their was a program called World This Week. This program made by NDTV (New Delhi Television) was one of the best current affairs program on the International Scenario and carried great stuff, which the regular NEWS failed to carry out. Prannoy Roy and his team used to give one of the best stuff and I would wait for this, especially during the end of the year, when they used to sum up the year in style.  N D T V …. STAR NEWS With Invasion of the Rupert Murdoch and his Television channels, Star wanted its own Indian version of Fox News channel and he did the right choice by bringing Prannoy and his team of NDTV to handle this entire 24hr news channel. 9.00pm was not the same after this news channel and instead of watching the soap opera, people really started watching news. Initially , I felt NDTV was doing a great job with round the clock news with its interesting mix of spicy , and live to the date News caster. But like most of the Rupert Murdoch creation, even Star News lost itself in this glamourous world of Entertainment and its service started getting worse with heavy concentration on Indian Politics.  P R O B L E M S   AT  S T A R N E W S The biggest problem at Star News was Imitating and Losing its focus because most of the News Reporter had become famous. Arrogance started moving in their blood or should I say, they also fell for the ”CHAIR”  KAMZOR KADDI KAUN….(WHO IS THE WEAKEST LINK)  Lack of Content The vision of Prannoy and his team is lost in the glory of Fame of this Glamrous Entertainment world and the content was also lost some where down the line. Politics started taking priority and the News was nothing but Heavy Duty Indian politics. Its really sad for a team which is so well funded they are loosing their focus. Just few days back, their was some scam at Coimbatore and it was indeed a big scam , I got the news from my parents because they watch SUN News and later on Aaj Tak. But Star forgot that, there are other things in the world apart from Politics. TIP Reduce this weak link and concentrate more on diversified News Platform.  SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION No!! No!! , don’t think that , I have problems with my cable operator and he has stopped showing Star News, but the interruption is for the News Presenters of Star News. One Question to all of you… Imagine you are being invited to the Star News and you are being interrupted every now and then by the News Presenter even before you have completed saying your view. I would have bashed up the News Presenter like Mike Tyson or left the show immediately. Its really sad to see, most of the guest being interrupted before even they have finished saying their view. The guest invited are mostly big and well known personality in their field, but SN Presenter are not bothered about that, they wont to put their points first with out even listening to what the Guest has to say. Hence, all the SN Presenters are Doordarshan’s “Sorry for Interruption”  TIP : Kaun hey jo Star News Ko All out Kar raha hey …(Who are the people who are hell bound on Closing Star News…)  WEAKEST AND THE WORST LINK AT STAR NEWS  Rajdeep Sardesai I know, most of you must be thinking, how the hell is Rajdeep the weakest link. The reasons are simple. Arrogant & Oversmart Leader of the Sorry for The Interruption Tries to pull the leg and also tease the Guest. No doubt , Rajdeep has got tremendous knowledge of the topic, probably that’s what has gone to his head and in the last year or so he has got lot of attention.  Sonia Verma Sonia Verma doesn’t know that there is something called Smile, because the way she speaks with the Guest is like some one has made forcefully to talk with the person. Rajdeep’s Close pal in the Sorry for the Interruption category.  Arnab (don’t know his second name) For a news presenter, its important that the person is consistent and doesn’t take lot of pause. But this gentleman has to pause for everything and you have to keep wondering what is he going to say after that pause. The viewer is always kept wondering.  TIP: Either Change these presenter or atleast tell them to improve…  STARS THAT SHINE AT STAR NEWS… Srinivasan Jain, Vikarm Chandra, Barkha Dutt Sonali Chander (For Sports News)  Prannoy Roy The real Star of Star News is but obvious is Prannoy and no doubt we don’t see him much often. He was the only presenter who had the consistency and the charm of taking to the entire 1hr of news with very much ease that you never felt like leaving the chair. His knowledge of the topic and most important his interactions with the Guest has been of Top Class. Probably Rajdeep has to learn lot of thing as far as Talking to Guest is concerned.  KAUN BANGYA CROREPATI … (Who became Millionaire) In this entire play of News Channel, Star earned lot of bucks and so did the Entire NDTV. But this money game has gone into their head and they have failed miserably and loosing their focus. But some of the positive which came out of this entire News Channel that it has become the India’s International Voice, what CNN is to US of A. Though Star has got some Stiff competition from Aaj Tak and the ever-improving Zee News and DD News. Hence lot of fine-tuning has to be done.  NEED TO IMPROVE …. If Star News want to be a leader then there are many changes needed: Change some of the News Presenter Diversify the News Content Reduce the Content on Politics."
ABPnews,Star News = * * * * *,5,"It is a very good news channel and infact of the indian news channels availble today it is the best. My opersonal preferences are Star,Aaj tak comparatively CNN and BBC give a much varied view of whats happening around town. My favorite part is ''India matters'' wherein some event which would not come into public view normally is brought to the open. The onsite reporters have put in a lot of hardwork to give live reporting from the scene of action. . Thje recent events in Afghanistan and more recently that which happened near Parliament are prrof of the committment to genuine information to the masses. They are also able to make and maintain a proper mix of news items to ensurethat we are rivetted to our seats. All in all a very good channel"
ABPnews,"ENGLISH BABU,DESI MEM...",4,"The title merits explanation.Star News(SN) is part of News Corp,a Rupert Murdoch enterprise.Again day-to-day operations is run by New Delhi Television(NDTV).NDTV is brainchild of Dr Prannoy Roy,a half-bengali-half-british economist.Son of an ITC honcho,Roy attended Doon,St Stephens and London School of Economics.After sundry research gigs he debuted as pollster with Dr Ashok Lahiri and Vinod Dua.He launched NDTV in '88 and after many awards for news faetures on DD & STAR started SN in 98. SN is aimed at and packaged for the elite,the cream of society.The anchors look well-fed,relaxed and well-rested at all times.There is a conscious attempt to be patrician and ivory-tower like.Even with Mr handsome Roy or Miss Congeniality Sonia Verma,SN sometimes seems stiff and a mahabore.But we need Star News just as we need go-karting."
ABPnews,Star News - More can be done,4,"News is an important part of knowing whats happening around us. I remember Prannoy Roy breaking the monotomy of the newsreaders of the earlier days with a lazy elegance, be it The World This Week or the News Services that they bought to DD II in the mid ninties. I also remember  Rajiv Menon, a colleague of Mr Roy lighting up his audience to the numerous facets of news reading. So it was naturally a delight when Prannoy Roy launched  Star News, a 24 hour news channel I admire the way the organisation has grown over the last 4 years. A mix of old and new faces cover the news for them. One could hardly miss the bubbly Sonia Verma, the stylist Vikram Chandra, the exploits of Barkha Dutt and the ever smiling face of Rajdeep Saradesai. Coupled with these anchors, they have developed good reporters across the country, the names I remember are Jennifer Arul (Chennai), Maya Sharma (Bangalore)apart from many others. This combination has so far done well for the organisation The crew, I believe is good enough to be a basic news provider, but in this era of Internet communication, I feel that they have not yet caught up with the speed of variation. Tune in to the 12 o'clock News and the 2 o' clock one, the same cassette is replayed. This does not augment to the organization. The programme variety is few and are very disassociated, and Star News needs to model itself in the likes of BBC or CNN. A young organization, it needs to grow out of just reporting news with more emphasis on other events like World Live Events and the BBC like panel discussions (I feel that the programme they have now is aptly called Street Fight as whenever I tune in, I see a brawl among the 3 participants)and other events like article reporting."
ABPnews,NEWS !! Not Boring Any More,5,"I remember those times when my dad used wait for the NEWS in DD all evening for that 1/2 hour of serious reading of news (more like somebody was reading a newspaper). Their attempt of making it interesting was excellent they would raise and watch the viewers for some time that’s when I think they realised they are actually addressing millions of helpless viewers. Well in the mid nineties there was this refreshing program in the same DD channel on Friday's between 10:00 PM to 10:30 PM. The program was called ''The World This Week''. Here suddenly we were introduced to this middle aged guy with a beard and smartly dressed in a suit who made current affair program a really interesting this was the earliest introduction to Indian viewers of New Delhi Television or NDTV as we know it now. The person who anchored and produced that show (also started NDTV) was none other then Prannoy Roy. He became such a hit that he was more of a star. People started to appreciate his political understanding with his excellent coverage of the elections (another feather in NDTV's cap). He also introduced to us the excellent Vinod Dua to us (well personally consider him the best we have when it comes to current affairs in Hindi). Continuing this great tradition NDTV soon tied up with STAR TV to give us the ''STAR NEWS'' channel. Here was complete 24-hour channel, which gave all round coverage of NEWS from current affairs to off beat to sports and entertainment. It was and still the only channel which has a repository of great news anchors who not only were excellent in their job but also went on to make great impact in their delivery they took TV journalism to great heights other news channels who came in were only loyal followers of STAR news. STAR news introduced some of the formidable guys in the news anchors like Vikram Chandra, Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep sardesai, Arnob goswani (with some exceptions like Pankaj Pachauri and erstwhile Amrita Cheema and some others) to name a few not to forget their comprehensive bureau spread all over the country who are always there where it matters. They are not only the first to get any news they are always accurate in what they report. One of the main strengths of Star News is their way getting on to right politician across all parties and they always get the important guy (like George Fernandes at the time of tehalka scam) when it really matters. The anchors know the right questions to ask to right person. They have got all the right moves. Enjoy!! Watching this news they are as best as they come. May their tribe increase."
ABPnews,Constipated Newsreader,3,"Has somebody heard one Pankaj Pachauri on STAR NEWS? The only one who is a shame to the likes of Rajdeep Sardesai, Barkha Datt and the great Pronnoy Roy. The guy almost gasps for breath every 2 minutes, with monosyllables thrown in, and a lot of aah, aa, aaa type breaks. Was this guy ever auditioned whether he can actually handle such an important job? Watch him talk to a dignitary and you will know how uninformed he is. Listen to him handling viewer queries and its enough to make one shut off the TV set. The solace is he knows Hindi as a language. But where to pause and where to lend emotions, that is out of his grasp. The all-time famous dheemi gati ka samachar bulletin, scores over this guys pathetic verbal antics. Quit Mr Pankaj, and let viewers rest in peace!"
ABPnews,Voice of India,5,"In today's world Content is King. And Star News follows this aspect as a motto. The issues that are of now are given precedence. Past issues and future analysis come but later. After Star Network went digital the quality of transmission of this channel became the best. As a child I enjoyed watching NDTV's ''The World this Week'' on Doordarshan on Fridays. I loved the way Prannoy Roy reads the news. Then he returned first with a half an hour show on Star Plus. Then they made a channel out of it and 24 hrs transmission. They have alternate Hindi and English news every half hour. Now they have become the leaders as far as news from an Indian perspective is concerned. They have wonderful anchors. In addition to Prannoy Roy I like the others like Rajdeep Sardesai, Barkha Dutt, Vikram Chandra and Sonia Verma. They are techno savvy too with phone interviews and reports, video interviews and live updates. They have a site too which is '' http://www.ndtv.com''. You can leave your thoughts there on all the leading headlines. The news is divided into nice sections. They have politics first, any crimes/explosions/wars next, then social events followed by Sports and Weather. In all I say this is one channel that you simply can't refuse to tune into."
ABPnews,ABP NEWS,3,"Hi All, ABP news have been a good channel, covering all news about politics, health, sports, filmy, monsoon, etc. All the Anchors are good and there way of speaking and informing is good. They have many shows like Samvidhan ki shapat, Mathrubhoomi, Saas bahu aur betiyaan, Sidha sawaal, Sansani,  etc. My favourite anchor is Rubika and Shobana. Love there way of speaking. I am giving 3 star because the advertisement is very irritating and repeated which makes us to turn off."
ABPnews,One of the best channel,5,"I love to watch this channel, the anchor and the reporters working are very good and doing their best job. they cover all the major news and let the public know about this. Kudos to the whole team of ABP news"

How can we trust in channels like this and what can we expect from them. Shame on this channel..."
ABPnews,Money Making TV Channel,2,"Some Time I saw, The ABP News do not Cover and  shows all news on his Channel in Maharashtra. ABP News need to know that We all Maharashtrian Saw your channel so you have to Show All Politicians or Other news on your channel. The ABP news need to make honest Channel. The ABP news make real news channel not a Money making channel. Hide some points the ABP news is really best for knowledge. I hope the You understand what I say.

ABPnews,The Orignal news channel,5,"Hello friends, Today I will tell about favorite news channel, ABP news channel. This is a hindi news channel. This channel's old name was star news. Which was two to three years ago today. This news channel always does the best justice. I never seen fake news here. The news that is shown in this channel is tide to us. In this channel, the government's imperfections and characteristics are also reported. This news channel always talks about poor people and farmers. Here we get very fast result and reports and news. The anchors of this news channel talk in a very straight forward language. I have a favorite program MASTER STROKE In this channel, which tells the government about the flaws. Apart from this, there are some programs like Viral Sach which gives us internet related news and the best Ghanti bajao program which tells the problem of the government to the government.  The best anchor of this channel is the 'ANURAG MUSKAN'. This channel does not forget to show the news but chases the news till the end. For this, I'm giving 5 stars to this news channel. Thank you"
ABPnews,It is not perfect news channel,2,"Hello guy's, I am talking about this news channel which always looks up to the news, if any news is small they mislead us too. I think, even show news outlets because most of their news goes wrong, they are also in the same time of the election, and they do not even come true according to entertainment . their hosts are not to entertaining, I think they do not have much variety to show the news . I do not think they would be able to satisfy anyone with their news."
ABPnews,No real content only beat around the bushes,1,"ABP news literally has no real content to share and it only beats around the bushes nothing else. I do not know what this channel do because it only spice up their TRP by serving the news that are not desirable, though some news are good but still I couldn't find anything that makes them different from others. Their content is appropiatly presented by their anchors, looks like they are deficit in their knowledge. They like to create the suspense first. It is very irritating that time, when they show up the same ad again and again.I think one should find a good channel than this one and the major disadvantage is that they show up ads more than the real news."
ABPnews,ABP News,3,ABP News is one of the channel of ABP network.ABP News is hindi news channel .This news channel is mainly focus on news in India and related to india .This news channel is one of the popular and trustable news channel in india.Thi news channels moto is to keep update all the viewers with daily news.Tagline is Aap ko rakhe aage.
ABPnews,Abp new awesome,3,Abp new channel is very popular channel of India.Its a really true new telecast from this channel my favourite show is viral such I am always see this show janman is also my favourite show .dibang is host Jan man at 9pm in abp new I love this channel saas bahu aur saazish I am see such a amazing show of this channel
ABPnews,Average news channel,1,This  news channel which is having no new of shadows there is copy of other news channels they simply read the news they don't go to the reality of the issues they frame some communal issues it is no use  for the society and I did not seen even a single debate programme and they always think about there TRP only not an issue or concern of society.
ABPnews,Boisterous ambience,1,"It is very bad watching news which is irrelevent to our perspective. One would like watching news which is relevent and useful to him. Abp news is a pompous channel. News makers make big lines but not relevent. Every evening when we watch debates , so their's boisterous environment makes you irritate. Abp news show you entertainment news more while educational news are never displayed. Programmes are not attractive. They show only trite based. Anchors are also bad tempered. I don't like much abp news."
ABPnews,Same news every time,1,"I will say content should be new and fresh every time for any news channel to remain in competition with other channels and for increasing viewers for your channel.in this regard this is main draw back for this channel. There are other things like lot of advertisements that too for fifteen and twenty minutes lengthy. Viewers  get bored while advertisements are on they change the channel instantly. One more thing every news can't be breaking news, they say so. News readers too get bored reading same news content, it seems from their gesture. Friends this is all I wanted to share ."
ABPnews,Packet of advertisement,1,The news viewed on this channel is older than the news shown in other channels . the anchor is not so good they are not fluent in speaking headlines. the headlines shown on the tv screen have the font size very small. the dressup of lady anchor of this channel is not so good . ghe lady anchor should were sarees during there shows becaulse they are here to show us  nation news nor they are here in fashion show. thanku
ABPnews,ABP news,1,"Dear friends Let me share my personal views about this news channel. We all know the income of these news channels comes by selling negativity about any one, be it a indian cricket team who lost its match against any team, any film star, any politicians. They never want to show good things about anyone unless they are paid heavily for the same. Two days back one of my friends send me a link of ABP news on youtube in which they are saying that one of fastest growing direct selling company in the world that they are doing scam in the India and their business in India is a scam. But when I researched about it, then found that the news which is being published is fake and 100% forged. The company and its products are 100 % genuine and the business is also legal. How come any News Channel can publish such things about anyone. Conclusion: - What is shown on this News Channel is not always genuine."
ABPnews,Good channel,4,ABP news is the most favorite channel of my. It is the very good news channel not only whole the world. Main important things about this channel it was come very good deabet and some time sting operation has been come to the Chanel. It is very good channel to see news.

ABPnews,Good,5,There was an advertisnment showing that mere kisan baddal raha hai. But the truth was farmer situation was not better that time. These channel used to show fake advertis& reality of farmer was extremely bad as shown. I am asking then y were u showing mere kisaan baddal raha hai.best best best best ??
ABPnews,Lost its originality :/,2,"When the channel change his name from Zee news to ABP all the thing gone to trash : / Now this news channel become useless. Every time they are showing repeat news and foolish his audience. They always come with new theme but it doesn't work from them. Only one thing is liked by me i.e DNA Only the reason why am seing this news channel. Unless until they are pathetic They only focus on top news and ignoring the regional ones. They have to highlight other state news also. Sudhir chaudhary is the reason why am watching zee news, he is loved by all. He has a good technique to attract the viewers. All I need to say is make some improvement to your news channel and keep it up : ) Thank you Sudhir's kudos : ) : )"
ABPnews,Mere kisan badal raha hai.,1,There was an advertisnment showing that mere kisan baddal raha hai. But the truth was farmer situation was not better that time.

ABPnews,Don't have good content,1,Yes we all know that the ABP news channel is the big name in it's field this is no.1 channelSo this is a responsibility of them that they show number onenessReason why they don't deserve number one position.1) tally cast so much ads.2) in India there is 30 states and they tally cast only Delhi-mumbai Delhi-mumbai news Hahaha some time I'm think I'm not living in India etc.There is so much to tell but I know they become what people think about them no.1.
ABPnews,Doesn't have much content..,1,"ABP news is the worst news channel till now. It doesn't have that much of information supply as compared to others. But few years back, it was the best among all of the news channels. But now it's contents are disgusting. Doesn't provide every essential news which a good news channel should have. Entertainment value is also very less. All programmes are very much boring because it never shows anything interesting. Qualities of programme which are shown on this channel is also very less. Only a few programmes are included. Host and anchors should get changed now because they are now old and public wants some new faces on their television screens."

ABPnews,The only trusted news channel,5,I have seen many news channel but abp news channel content is highly authentic. It does not support any political party and is neutral. It praises the government when beneficial work is done by it and criticizes when any misconduct is done. It is not a paid news and presents the factual information before the people. It raises important maters in its debate session and often asks genuine question from the spokesperson of different parties. It has also raised the corruption and black money issues several time and in a way has forced the corrupt people to think over their deeds.
ABPnews,ABP news the honest news network,4,"Almost all peoples see programs on TV. some people like cartoons, news, music, movie etc but now, lets talk about news. I watched many news channel, I liked the most is ABV news . Its quality of news also good and the news which they are showing is true, interesting. If I am bored at home I am always viewing the ABP news so news are most important by watching them we knowing, what is going on all over world. at last if you have never seen ABP news then see it and if you really like it you should support it."
ABPnews,Unreliable news channel!,2,"ABP news has some good journalists like Abhisar Sharma and some good programs like Bharatvarsh etc but mostly, they show biased news! They can't do honest journalism when needed! I watch it sometimes though whenever my favorite program is on! It keeps leaning on to the right wing bias every now and then, so I don't think it can be called as a trustworthy source of news!"
ABPnews,Good news chann,4,I am  watching this channel since 4 years. They provide real and clear news. I love to watch viral news only abp news provides this show. Abp also care on social media thats viral specially on facebook and whatsapp they show fakeness or reality of viral news. Thanks to ABP NEWS that it is also available on DD free dish
ABPnews,Another Paid News Channel,2,Hi I have been watching news channel in  every night for last 20 years. I have not seen the no. Of channel taht has been bias in there content. ABP news is not different from the other leading news channel. Every channel is floating in one direction. And that to to impress one songle party.  Which is sad that for our country. All thd some of the shows are good in ABP news. But anchors are doning what they have to do to impress and taking side of one particular party. And not listening the oppoaition party.
ABPnews,More news covers every area,4,"Hi friends, I am sahil nanda from new delhi and I share my experience with you. I always watch news in night , sometimes I didn't seen the channel name. Just news is my first priority but after some time I have seen some news channels show fake news to get some publicity or in some channels more advertisements are shown. Now I always watch abp news because it covers every aspects and I also like his show viral sach and 100 news. They also make some shows on history which I like the most.

ABPnews,A chilly Channel,3,"Hi this is just the experience with ABP news and After watching it everyday I am feeling that ABP news channel is just selling the news rather then having any authencity of the news.Thetly present their chaneel with hot anchors wnd chilly material whuch dont have base.If I talk about the awareness of a particular topic of society, country and any social topic, that will be always missing.They dont care about anything just selling news as usual.A good new channel shd always present good news with 90% authencity, avoid any rumours of the fact and give people trueness of the fact.And ABP always decline the quality of th news."
ABPnews,To the point News.,5,"I have  been a fan of ABP news since it was called Start News.Today we have more than 50 news channels to choose from, but I choose ABP news only because their content. They report the news as they are, not addition of MASALA for TRP. I always follow ABP's exit polls as they are most of the time 95% correct.Their shows like Bharat Varsh which is being hosted by Anupan Kher are supurb, do make some more shows like this. I had downloaded ABP mobile app as well for instant updates of news when I am away from home.I am sure yu would also love their unbiased reporting."
ABPnews,Make fake breaking news,2,I am bishal sah. Some day ago I saw a programme dastan e jurm and at the bottom of my TV screen I saw a breaking news. It is flashed in TV sreens bottom.

ABPnews,ABP-News. What are you  really watching?,1,Abp news is said to be one of the leading news channel in India. But on the other hand it has its own way to present news. I find this channel a exists only for TRP purpose. Its most of the news is produced in more dramatic manner to divert people that it really a real concerning news. It most program's are literally of no focus. Its whole concept revolves around propaganda. You will often find reporting one side on this channel. Which is not a sign of good media. Childish half hour screen edited video with same footage again and again to convey a single sentence message is common on this channel. Anchors often seems to be tryiing real hard to make big news out of small news
ABPnews,Abp news,5,Abp news pe rozana achi khabr ati aur bhot sare letest bhi news ye dikhate hai isme na to add zyada bhi nahi dekha te isper rozana 3 baje sireal ka bhi program dikhate hai hum log is ko riz follow karte hai aur jo nahi unhe bhi karna chahiyye kyun ke ye ek channel hai isme koi sakh nahi aur in ke anchar bhi ache hum log roz dekhte hai agar cricket ki baat ho to inke channel score bhi fatafat update ho jata ye bahot acha aap log bhi dekhe

Anchors are good but the plot and presentation is not good that sets back. Programs are good sometimes and produces informative news. Most I like is Halla Bol program and Press Conference.

ABPnews,BAD CHANNEL,2,ABP NEWS - APKO RAKHE AGE it wont keep you ahead instead force you back by showing false and bad news dont ever rely on the info provided by this channel as what I noticed was that this channel works for money and shows illogical news or show news with many ad ons just for increasing its trp and also its profits! more the trp more the companies gonna pay them for advertisements sometimes they favour a particular political party sometimes the other even if the news papers and other channels show a copletely different story! THIS CHANNEL IS NOT AT ALL RELIABLE AND THE INFO SHOULD NOT BE BELIEVED I f you have this channel just remove it from you list or dont watch it ever the crimes shown by them are completely diff from them shown in newspapers I hope the review was useful THANK YOU
ABPnews,Worst news channel,1,Guys please if you have subscribed this news channel please just unsubscribe it. This news channel works only for its profit that is trp this channel CREATES news on its own. also most of the time this channel gives add also this channel gives some of the worst news if you check this channel you will come to know about it soon. This channel works only for the political party which hires this news channel
ABPnews,Biased News Channel,1,Totally a biased news channel. Half of the news are fake and displays only for TRP. Programs less in this channel and complete advertisements which makes the channel watch irritates. Only for TRP the anchor and hosts pretend saying in such a way that it makes you feel hitting them. Be alert and be a smart news updater . Watch other channels in order watching this biased fake news channel. Complete crap only for TRP and I strongly don't recommend.
ABPnews,ABP News is Biased News Channel,2,"Most of the time I spent on television on watching news and news-debate because it is good to be aware whats going on society and world. I watched many different news channel but whenever I watched ABP News channel especially watching debate with host Sumera Khan and Abhinav, I found they did not allow many panellists especially from BJP and VHP to speak much and they will ask irrelevant questions to those panelists and not let them speak and ask easy questions to other panelist. Even their headlines also seems to be like biased. It seems like they are working on some agenda by giving biased news. Except some of their programmes like'Press Conference' and'Viral sach', all programmes are boring and the most boring is'Saas Bahu Aur Saazish'. People should not watch this ABP News as they are biased news channel."
ABPnews,Worst news channel,2,"ABP news channel is the worst news channel. They shows too many advertisment on his channel. News anchors are not so trained they are not good enough. They shows that their channel is india's number one channel but my point of view they are not best. They shows very few type of news shows in the morning like fatafat51 fatafat 101.they shows same news on both of these channel. They have to learned from zee news, aajh tak, India tv these are the leading news channels of India. One thing is good about this channel is they have good qualitys of programs"
ABPnews,Abp,3,Many Hindi news channel we used to watch everyday. one of them is abp news. it is fantastic channel.All anchors of this channel present the news full of intensity. The graphic of this channel is also attractive.this channel try to any type of issue in the people through television. As well as they get the feedback through internet what's people opinion about issue.my suggestion to all the people to watch this channel .before this news channel is known by star news but after some time it convert is abp news. I used to watch this channel everyday.
ABPnews,ABP News - Not up to mark,3,"We all know that media is just like fourth pillar in any democratic nation. ABP was doing good from the last so many years and want to appreciate that ABP proves it(fourth pillar). But don't know what happened to channel or its think tank. Now ABP supporting every anti-national element, don't know why? This is not only my view. Now its became a fashion to sit with anti-element people and support them. If civilians can't decide whether he is culprit or not than how can channel do this? Again want to repeat ""This is not only my view."""
ABPnews,ABP News,5,"I am vipul.i was always watching ABP News.this is good channel.this channel all india latest new information.elections news, cities news, village news it. all india large network ABP News. ABP News is good and right information it.ABP News team is good work.this channel is all latest new information it. ABP News channel election right information it.this channel is good and excellent.my family always watching ABP NEWS."
ABPnews,Not good as other news channel,2,Most of the time this channel shows masala news . And the news anchor get engry when some body critisize them. They should show real news not fake news. Lots of advertisment between news it make irritate . And the debate progrram they shows their angerness.
ABPnews,Definitely not worth your time.,2,"ABP News has gone through a dynamic fall through in recent time in terms of providing quality news for it's viewers. It's more of a saas bahu channel now and showcasing celebrity lifestyles. Hardly can I find some useful content in it. Also, some of it's anchors are heavily biased towards a singly party and so fail to represent their own view. ABP should focus on creating betters shows and literally lower the content of Daily soap drama so as to be a proper news channel."
ABPnews,Not good channel,1,"India is demolished by legislative issues, and these channels are their publicist. ABP news is likewise one of the promoter. This news channel have some great grapples yet substance is not in the least great. Most the news show extraordinarily identified with governmental issues are one-sided. They simply divulge one side of the coin, this is plainly reasonable. More often than not they show amusement news like motion pictures television events commercial. The greater part of the news are rehashed. They once in a while do any examination or investigation by any stretch of the imagination. At some point it feels like we are observing some masala film channel as opposed to news channel. Subsequent to watching this channel for at some point you feel like, was there any news showed till now."
ABPnews,Media channel,5,Abp channel is one of those channel those gives us real information about what is happening in our country. They have a superhit show aap ki adalat.this show is hosted by rajat sharma.this is soo popular that even prime minister and bollywood celebs have already been on the show. This show named star news before but they changed their name recently.i always watch that.
ABPnews,Good,4,All media channels are good. Because its also provide latest news for all. ABP news channel is also good because its also provide all types of news to people which is some related for information and technological. And its media work is best and better.
ABPnews,Paid media,1,"Hello friends, Today news channel are one of our best tool to get aware of daily happening and important news. They should do their duties properly and honestly. But media channels like ABP news are worstly performing their duties. I use to watch this channel regularly a year ago but Now I got fed up of their negative news. Even they do not follow news, they try to create it. All of us know that they have been linked with congress party. From the time bjp gets in centre and aap gets in delhi they feel like orphans. Whatever rahul gandhi say that will be true to them. They tried to find negativity in each news of centre and non- congress ruling governments. Basically congress is god and father to them. They also use to waste our time by showing waste episodes of saas bahu and sajish. They feel proud on sansani. People who can watch savdhan India or crime patrol, why they will follow sansani. My suggestion is very simple, please shut down this channel rather that show wrong news. I don't even want to give this channel a rating but Its mouthshut's terms that we have to."
ABPnews,Best news channel,5,"ABP news channel is a good channel of the television channel.ABP news channel is a category of the news channel.News channel reporters is also provide a quick and fast news on the ABP news channel.and they provide a news of all over category related sports, business, technology, all over world ect.the reportes is all over any places any big news to provide a reporter news on a people. Very famous channel on news category. People can be trust on the ABP news channel.they provide news on hindi.quality of programe is also good."
ABPnews,Best news channel,5,"Abp news is best channel among all news channel.I hate all other news channel.they are always updated with the current topics that are going on and doesnt show other silly topics.they have varieties of programs and my best program is ramrajya. I only trust abp channel they just focuses on the quality of their programs. Other news channel always show many advertisements while showing news and I have to search for news in very small space in my tv but abp news doesnt do this. They also have very talented reporters and hosts who present news in very suspicious manner.anchors who host debates etc are very educated and sharpminded persons they take very high quality interviews and debates from politicians, actors etc. They have very wide range of programs ranging from music, sports, drama to interviews debates etc.if any one wants to see trustworthy news watch abp news."
ABPnews,Good news on it,5,ABP news channel is best hindi news channel in india.in india largest watchers of this hindi news channel is this only.i m big fan of this channel news channel.reality shows like app ki adalat is my fav tv channel it is reality show and good to watch it.

This channel makes my day and I will always rate it 10 out of 10 coz it is best channel ever I had  seen.subscribe and enjoy world news
ABPnews,Ad channel not news channel,3,ABP news is okay channel but not as good as it was earlier.Now a days they give ad more than news Delivery of news by their anchor is good and appreciable but sometimes I feel that they don't give chance to all to express their views. Overall channel is okay but ABP news channel become the best if they show news on their channel more than ads. ABP news channels provide news in real time. Thanks
ABPnews,Hume Rakhe Aagey,4,"ABP News is a popular Hindi News Channel made its debut as STAR News in March 2004 and was rebranded to ABP News from 1st June 2012. The vision of the channel is ""'Aapko Rakhe Aagey' -the promise of keeping each individual ahead and informed. ABP News is best defined as a responsible channel with a fair and balanced approach that combines prompt reporting with insightful analysis of news and current affairs. ABP news is a popular and leading news channel. The ABP News is one my favourite news channel followed by aajtak, ABP news channel is providing all type of news related to National, International, Government and etc.news channel anchors r also good have good experiance so, present themself with news very well. It is an 24x7 news channel so there is lots of entertaining program running in offs hours, two program I hate most is sas bahu or sajis & 6 pm useless debate apart from this abp is great. New program is telecast by abp news called press conference which is hit, where all the controversial person are interviewed by reporter debaang & by his news expert team"
ABPnews,One the best Hindi news channels.,4,"The ABP News is one my favourite news channel. The concepts of the show are very good and realistic like News positive, khabar fatafat, selfie, sas bahu aur sazish, etc. The channel was first known as star news. I don't like some of the anchors like mahira they look ugly on news channel. They are covering news from all over the india. Which is really tough job to do. The ad duration of the channel is low."
ABPnews,Ossum1?!,5,"Abp news is  hindi news channel covering all the news. Abp news is a fast news channel. Thay connduct lot of ossum shows with grate senior journalist. Like, desh videsh by sumaira khan, Aj ki tarik by kishor advani, Bada prashna by abhisar shSarma, . Press conferance is a grate show hosted by devn. Specially, I love sannsanni. Overll abp news is trustable channel. It gives you fair news. So watch this channel and stay updated with the world."
ABPnews,Star ABP NEWS,4,"I also watch the ABP NEWS. Here we are watching the news of india very fastly and true news. This channel is only on news channel. Here we are watching the special person show. In this show we know about the there history, sacrifice and there personality.  We are watch the political news, sports news and entertainment news. The clearity of channel is better than others news channels.  And here you watch biggest news of today in India and other countries.  The hosts and anchor are good.  They speaking very well and introduced the news very well manners. There channel is the very popular channel for there news. I would recommend you to watch ABP NEWS."
ABPnews,BEST NEWS CHANNEL,4,"According to me it is best news channel which telecasts news not the political drama they Have experienced Anchors who have the Abbility to attract audience, they have good contents to offer, I like saas bahu and sajish, but not its anchor she is sometimes irritating, there style of debate is very good every day new debate .There studio is good and have good contents to offer, Its one of the most loved news channel In Indian Newz fraternity."
ABPnews,Abp timepas news,1,"The abp news will be not be news chanal .This is a politics news chanal .The abp news not concated village people . A abp news have been there are politics party aam aadmi party, BJP and congres party news. A abp news nagetive resopnse of the many many mango people.They have been the abp news to be makeover news.The abp news not be concern .This is the newa the other news same news will be dilvered to public"
ABPnews,ABP News,4,Abp news is not new channel it was first name as star news.Yes your favourte star news channels has changed there name as ABP news few years ago many people think it is new channel it screen same show it.The abp is has very different show one of my family favourte show is 24 ghante 24 khabar.It is very nice here you get all the day and breaking news at once it may dont take big break they perform nicely the news and telecasting of this channel is very fast you might beaware of some shows of the abp news.It is nice channel for Indian news tv.
ABPnews,Unnecessary debates and exaggerated reports,1,"ABP news is one of the leading news channels but personally I am not so in favour of this channel. The news shows are repetitive, exaggerated and shown in altogether different way. Every day in evening, Unnecessary Debate question takes place wherein all political leaders from different parties are called for the debate. Any pertaining problem or news is linked to politics by ABP news. The only good shows on ABP news are Press conference and Saas bahu aur Saazish, rest all day all shows have same content but with different name. There are so many advertisement breaks in between that it becomes irritating to watch even a single show. Aaj tak and NDTV shows more substantial news than ABP news."
ABPnews,Too Much Ads On TV and APP,2,"ABP News is an Indian news channel claimed by ABP Group.[1] It was before known as STAR News and was possessed by a joint endeavor between News Corporation possessed STAR TV/Fox International Channels. However, I didn't find anything useful specially the app, At whatever point you tap on article the greater part of time it demonstrates no article substance to show. What's the point to make application if there is no news to peruse. Video won't play in any dialect. Winds up in a clear screen. What is amusing is, April 7 upgrade is stating this issue is altered. Try not to squander your time. This application really merits a - 1 rating. As far as tv channel, news are good but they also shows too much of advertisment, one show which I like most is 24 Ghante 24 Reporter."
ABPnews,Star news,3,"I call it star news though it's name changed way long back.It is a hindi language news channel of India .it also have some highest trp rate in india.it also most-watch news channel of India.It's content is somewhat ok I guess.There are a lot of news channel availble nowadays and the there is a cut throat competition out there. They give you some very good entertainment and while they cover almost all the topics revelent and things which are current affairs, I find them to very baised.Either they are criticising the govt. and they don't give a good ending to their discussion.They end rather abruptly.News reporters and achors are average, not great but yes.not bad either.Their debates always have a underlying subtune to it.It's rather monotonous and the points which they ponder upon alway points to a particular direction."
ABPnews,A perfect news channel,5,"Abp news is a news channel that shows the fresh news on the television very firstly. The anchors and hosts do their job well. The range of programmes is very vast. In morning starting from Bhajan and ending with A fast bulletin of news at night. Channel shows Bhajan at early morning that makes my mind fresh and devote me towards the god. After that astrology show starts telling us how our day will go and what good and bad happen with us , also they tell us solution to the problems. After that morning news first bulletin starts that shows up the main headline and descibe it in a few words.In afternoon they telecasts a business show to tell viewer about the market plans, stock market, riseor down in stocks and ask questions. They also conduct a fast bulletin of 100 news that last long for 20 minutes for those people who do not have enough time to see each and every news of the world. This bulletin is a mixture of sports, bollywood films, politics, development and other types of news. They also show such bulletins at night. They also had a long discussion on the ongoing topics and news in india also they talk of cricket with experts and get their views to the viewers. This channel is full of news that may vary from time to time giving us information what is happening around the world"
ABPnews,Best news channel,5,Yes it is a best news channel in india n its a top leading channel also bcz this channel is very old I guess from 2000 almst 15 yrs of their fame. And still they giving best news with full profe and some interesting facts also which importnat for all the indian it could be history politics bollywood n other thing ABP new alwy their it means APKO RAKHE AGE what a tag line loving this channel you can see all type news all over the world

News24,Say your reporters to wear masks,3,Why do some of your reporters don't wear masks and then shout in people's face when they are not allowed to go though. I am not going to upload a photo.
News24,One of the worst news channel,1,"The way the Indian media is behaving for the past few years has become nuisance. I came across this channel while going through various news channels during election times. Only the opinion poll they showed had some sense. Rest of the content is terrible. They used to report against Nirmal Baba few months back and now they telecast his show from 2pm in the noon, this is ridiculous. I know it is meant for commercial purpose but still a standard should be maintained by the media. Apart from that during cricket world cup they had panel in which there was a man who had no knowledge of cricket and still insulting the team whether we win or lose. Yes there is huge competition in today's world but they should atleast try to maintain the dignity of a news channel. NDTV India is one news channel left in Hindi news channels which is a little better compared to others."
News24,Best news channel,3,News 24 id the best chanal. Always reporting lest news in word. Quality is suprab. The most important part of news 24 is my life. I am always watching to all times. News 24 new coverage is very best. And all ancer is good. New parrogance is very good.
News24,Debate Aar Paar by Arnish Devgon,1,The debate are normally on good topics but anchor with its presentation makes it funnier.Anchor try to speak most of time and interrupt panelists. Trying to give dose of patriotism and brand anti nationist to the panelist who don't support his view point People want discussions in a good manner and anchor should focus on asking questions.
News24,True news,5,"Hi guys News 24   is a 24-hour Hindi News Television channel owned by B.A.G. Films and Media Limited. News 24 is free-to-air channel in India.The internet is awash with social media platforms which allow unfettered free speech and increasingly are the more comfortable home of online conversation  News 24 is one of the best reality news channel. It is give true news, news 24 is extremely good. We all update on reality day by day, If some one really wants unbiased news then I think it is one of the new s channel in India which can provide so reality.These press releases give half-baked and twisted information and they are published as such. The first rule of journalism is never to accept anything on its face value. However most of the news channels have probably forgotten this rule."
News24,News 24 - No news only crap,2,"Useless channel no news only general crap they telecast. Whole day they run sponsored program. Poor reporting quality such news channel should be banned. One news is repeated thousand times, they make their user change the channel by not showing quality news. They run one crapy horoscopic show kalchakra thrice a day. If you are a hindi speaking audience please prefer another news channel for quality news."
RepublicTV,Too much shouting,2,I feel that republic tv is more a debate channel rather than news channel . And most of the time news anchor is seen shouting at the panel which really is unpleasant for most of the people and also most of the debates keep on repeating all day which does not keep audience stick to the channel . We have decent news channels like cnn and times now that also have debates but anchors dont shout on panel. So diginity needs to be maintained
RepublicTV,Only for Arnab,5,Really you are great and your channel as well.just keep continue with your target. You have lots of energy to handle the all panels during show. You have the guts to raise the voice against the people like corrupted... Rally you people are trying to make our country proud..
RepublicTV,Worst channel ever,1,Worst news channel ever in history of india. Dont know how much money they take from BJP.Just hate watching this news channel. Only fake&in our desi language farzi news on this channel. This channel is free on TV . Dont know how to stop this channel coverage on my TV. Third  class anchor. BJP puppet shameless anchor. Dont have words to describe this thirdclass channel.
RepublicTV,Indian writes,5,You are the best Arnab. We all love you so much. May god bless you and let you win against all evils.
RepublicTV,Over reacting,1,I think this channel is over reacting . media hai to aache se bolna chahiye arnab sir ko jayada shoutout nhi krna chahiye . ok
RepublicTV,No.1 News Channel,4,The channel was no.1 music channel. The members of this channel was realy doing very hard work.They collect  and post new feed for us everyday.Thanks for your team.
RepublicTV,Arnab,3,You are such a great reporter. The kind of energy you have is just awesome. My mind accepts any thing you tell. Just feels great listing your news. Hope you continue like this. Best luck
RepublicTV,#goarnabgo,1,"Arnab goswami is a fake reporter who shows the news according to their trp . They cant show the main news to get in action like rapist , exorcism , Economy etc. Although They shows the filmstarts suicide news. #fakearnab"
RepublicTV,Reality about Republic bharat,3,In real it is a good news channel and it also attract people by their performance .its way of attracting people is that they tell news by shouting .if republic bharat is saying any news about any thing then it clearly declared that this should be happen rather than thinking about that why it is not happening .Now a days republic bharat had been accused that they buy TRP by unfair means and I am not saying that its 100% true but if smoke is coming then there must be fire anywhere.Ihave fully believed in government that whatever decision they take it will be in favour of all . Thanks
RepublicTV,It's coward not journalist,1,"All time souting so called anchor ,  abusing government broadcasting ministry government paid propongenda runner it cell manager"
RepublicTV,Non informative news,1,Republic tv is not soo much informative its just like debate channels not good waste of time to see this channels for news
RepublicTV,Liked it,3,I feel Arnav and Republic Bharat is doing a great job only one this which needs to be improve as to be a good listner. The issues which their team takes up front is really worth appreciating.
RepublicTV,Horrible channel,1,"I didn't call it ""horrible news channel"" cause that isn't news. It's like a channel with a lot of noise."
RepublicTV,Very bad channel,2,Public TV very very channel anchor republic TV Arnab Goswami metar a politics other countries and Veri Veri bed anker is rost channel
RepublicTV,Not a genuine news,1,"On this news channel only there are debates not any other news and they debate on bullshit Topics , so other news channels are better ."
RepublicTV,Sound pollution,2,This chanel must be banned by the goverment or pepole reject their telecast. Its only shouts useless things and arrange talkshow like one man army. This channels has no ethics to telecast their news. They target some special person regarding news. They gives only views not news.
RepublicTV,Is Republic tv is trust worthy,1,"A Great Jounalist who has lost his way !  This is the best way I can say about Arnab Goswami , He is undoubtedly a Talented Person . He was educated from top notch college and university , He studied sociology . Yes I agree with Arnab in some time where he come forward and give voice to voiceless but not always , he had to think to not only speak but also give sometime to other one also to put his point in debate I have total respect from me when , He opened files of 1995 'Parulia Arms drop' - A case where a Congress Government had got Arm air - Dropped into West bengal to destabilize the state Government . He Finally, I was totally in awe of him when he questioned the hot heads of Bhartiya Janta party like Yogi Adityanath. “A neutral, fearless journalist at last” - I said to myself. I let go his interview of Narendra Modi “in the larger interest of journalism”"
RepublicTV,News,5,"Gives a original news focus on the farmers prboblems and face every challenge at any time gives breaking news  firstly , well gesture ."
RepublicTV,Good Arnab,3,Why are all the channels ganging up against Arnab although the follow what Arnab is doing .Chill and watch Republic .If you dont want to give TRP dont watch
RepublicTV,Awesome new,5,I would not hesitate to recommend this channel. I would be 10 start if i would. Thank you Republic Bharat Channel.
RepublicTV,Yes The Channel Should be banned,1,Not only this channel other channels like aajtak and zee news should be banned to arnab has resigned but he has already secured his 7 figure salary
RepublicTV,"Useless channel, no news, shouts",1,"Chillao, aur chillao, noise noise, no news only chillao, bhonkte raho bas yahi hai ye channel, joker tv"
RepublicTV,Don't shows real news......,1,"Bad , never shows real news , mislead .."
RepublicTV,Worst channel and overacting anchors,1,This channel is worst channel I ever seen I m life all anchors are stupid and nonsense talk anchors are always do overacting worst channel worst worst worst worst
RepublicTV,This channel is only doing TRP,1,I don't like shouting and only shouting feeling always like something is wrong i didn't seen this channel only work for trp . News channel stop this type of working
RepublicTV,News channel or a National gossiping Channel ?,1,"I landed on this news channel this morning. They were showing the news about Sushant's death case. I was shocked to hear the words which the anchor and the reporter were using. They were passing their comments on Rhea Chakraborty and what they think about her, how arrogant and careless she is to not reach to the place she was summoned to. The reporter is saying - ""What does she think of herself, this made me very angry"" and the anchor is totally bullying her on a National TV Channel saying ""It's not the time to apply make up on your face, you are not going on a set but for an official cause. What's taking you so long? "" I haven't seen such repugnant comments being given any news channel. It's beyond pathetic and shameful. They are acting as if she's done some newest kind of crime buying drugs. It's a known issue in the society and should be treated and dealt in a civil manner instead of just passing your own judgments which no one really cares about. She has no been proven guilty yet so you have no right to disgrace her. Your job is to report to the public what's going on in country and not what YOU think about everything unless you are participating in any debate. Again, to put it in a better way, you Reporters and Anchors are not sitting there to pass judgments but to state facts and ask the right questions to reach to the truth. And looking at your news channel, you're doing a PATHETIC Job. Learn some decency from other reputable news channels. P. S. Just so everyone knows I'm neither a supporter of Rhea Chakraborty nor any other news Channel. I'm speaking as an individual."
RepublicTV,Wonderful News Channel,5,"Republic Tv is the best news channel. Shows facts and real news. Arnab Goswami is best journalist and their team as well like Suhail, Jyothsna & Pradeep Bhandari. They all are doing wonderful journalism and covering each and everything. Hatts of to these journalists, they are doing such a hard-work for covering the news. Love to see the debates of Arnab Goswami. Me n my family only watch republic tv. Thankyou so much Repubic tv"
RepublicTV,PLEASE STOP SHOUTING & RESPECT ALL.,1,"Hi Arnaab, Wonder why there is always extra furore & roars on your channel, that we tend to shift to other channels!!! You and your reporters need to respect the debaters, viewers and the suspect or accused whom your channel have already declared to be criminals!!!! Firstly we are not deaf, cluless or brainless to get into your talks!!!! Please stop disrespectful behaviour towards our Mumbai Police! We need to be grateful to them!Nobody is perfect, and, during this pandemic there is possibility for lapses.They don't sit in air-conditioned rooms protected from COVID 19....they are on Ground Zero which you can't fathom!!! Think about it.... Respect the guardians of our loving Mumbai and Mumbaikars by speaking slow, legible, to the point...and definitely we will try to watch your channel!!!!! Good Luck, Jai Hind. Jai Maharashtra."
RepublicTV,Calm Down,3,Republic channel is more of a debate platform where news anchors are most of the time shouting and cause of this viewers are unable to understand and listen the news clearly. All the anchors and host are very sharp with loud and clear statements only the think I dislike they are rushing while talking which may cause for some viewers  to understand the news. Be calm and composed while talking.
RepublicTV,Worst news channel in the world,1,"Worst channel, with stupid anchors who argues on totally irrelevant topics, i want to give 0 stars but there is no option for that"
RepublicTV,Republic Bharat is best media Chanel,3,"It is a good channel doing lot of research befor presenting a topic. Arnab has lot of energy and dominate personality. The channel is a good response to all media channels, which are biased against the present government. R. Bharat definitely need credibility check journalism in india."
RepublicTV,Banned this channel in u.k.,1,Is this a news channel? Really where everyone shouts like they are only people living in the world My view is this channel should be shut a.s.a.p. It is no good for this country
RepublicTV,Best news channel I have ever seen,5,"Thank you  Arnab Sir for such a wonderful channel.  I am big fan of yours.  We need such a wonderful news channel which shows true colors of our politicians', so called secularists'  mindset. We can hear patriotism in your each and every words you speak in your program. Thanks a lot and we are with you"
RepublicTV,One sided media. works for government,1,This media works for govt and not for people. especially arnab who has destroyed the Indian media. hate driven media
RepublicTV,"Godi media ,sold to BJP ,BJP channel",1,I have stopped watching republic tv since 2015 bcz this channel totally supports BJP.....Even one star is more to give... Indian news channels are mostly fake... except NDTV
RepublicTV,CAB n Arnab the watch dog of Modi Govt,1,Arnab is presently in between devil n sea while leading the discussion on CAB. He can't take a clear stand on the issue. If takes a stand in favour he cant put his foot in Assam n if he opposes the bill hewill loose his mentors Modi n Amitsha. Poor guy n devils advocate. We can see the pain on his face eventhough trying divert the issue on the shoulder owaisi.
RepublicTV,Arnab from republic tv,1,He is modi puppet (modi ka ganda andha puppet ) jaisi uski shakal waisa uska kaam.instead od republic tv u must keep modipublic tv arab an assole
RepublicTV,Technical issues,3,I strongly suggest Republic TV management to do something to synchronise audio and video. It happen always that video comes before audio. In the bargain we loose the sanctity of discussion
RepublicTV,Fake Indian News Channel,1,"Tremendous thanks to the developers for giving us the opportunity to put 1 star toward here fake Indian news channel. The news channel doesn't have guts to open their review options to the public, It clearly means that they are doing big mistakes and against their ethics for their viewers. This is particularly appreciated because people could understand the real face of Arnab and BJP. Clearly, Arnab is behaving like a slave of them.Mr.Arnab if you will get free time please go and study Indian political history,  It will help future while your old age."
RepublicTV,Totally biased towards BJP,1,"Not a single negative point about BJP is discussed here and deeply influenced  by rajeev chandrashekhar and anupam kher's wife who are in BJP. Also, Modi only visits and give interviews to them who are sold to BJP and he has no guts to face Ravish Kumar or any other Independent channels like The Wire, scroll or quint."
RepublicTV,Bakavas,1,This is the third class channel I donâ€™t understand why they show only good things about bjp party .

All the time they show news against congress . I think this channel should be banned

RepublicTV,Fake News Channel,1,"Programmed like News Channels. No commitment towards truth. Totally committed towards its promoters, BJP MP and self-satisfying news anchor Mr. Arnab Goswami ............................................................................................................................................"
RepublicTV,Worst Media spreading Hatred everywhere !!!,1,"One of the worst news channel that was ever created in the history of news media.. bjp puppet.. full of noise and create no value to people who want to think.. even does not even let it viewers to think about the issues as no onecant hear anything. Full of propaganda, all fake news..when a channel is formed by the help of a Lok sobha member of the BJP, then it clearly goeswhy it alwaysshows news against the ConfCongress and each of us understood that clearly. I would request the International News Media or if has a autonomous institution of some shape or form to take punishable action to them as they are the main propagandist in dividing this great nation on the perspective of religion."
RepublicTV,Puppet of a specific political party,1,"It's not at all a news channel, the worst news channel, full of propoganda and biased news, all anchors only know how to shout and shout ..it better to watch some decent liberal news channel which shows good news like NDTV news channel.. Arnb is most pathetic, he can do anything for money, they have already sold their news channel to one party."
RepublicTV,"Too much aggression, unnecessary",1,"Too noisy.. Too much aggression.. Too much repeated content.... And funny reporters..... They try to become junior Mr. Arnab.... Which for them is very difficult.. Coz the level of irritation Mr. Arnab has, could not be copied by anyone.... They can be good but don't copy the same thing what Mr. Arnab had done."
RepublicTV,Too much noise and full of non-sense,1,"This is worst news channel, always full of noise and non-sense debates. Self proclaimed nationalist Arnab has zero knowledge of journalism, his channel spreads fake news and never apolozises . Never talks about bad policies of current government, never questions govt authorities. Such channels are just brainwashing audience, damaging their common sense."
RepublicTV,The best of the worst,1,"Its a sad state of affairs. These professional anchormen, who should provide a genuine and unbiased view are behaving like hired goons. In the garb of journalism, they are not only trampling the very democracy they claim to protect, they are in fact ruining the reputation of the free press in India.  These pseudointellectuals, using their knowledge of English language, try to bulldoze the opposition and mask their untoward intentions. It seems that their command over the use of English has given them a licence to falsify a news and unnecessarily shout and scream with all the finesse of a theatre artist. If there is any way we can get these fake news channels banned, it would be the greatest act of nationalism.  Just because somebody is able to use English to further his ulterior motives, we can't be mute spectators and let him milk the system and fool millions.   Its a cry for help. WE NEED TO BAN THESE SELF-PROCLAIMED PSEUDONATIONALIST."
RepublicTV,Try spreading News which helps our country grow,1,"I think that such a reputed news channel in India, which gained success in a short span should provide us with news which matters to the whole country like the problem going in India's falling GDP,  People losing jobs, etc. But they always go off track and always provide nonsense news and debates. They only talk about celebrities, cases which give them more TRPs. They just don't know what is a debate, they just shout and use abusive words to prove their point. This isn't journalism, Journalism is unbiased. The public should decide what should be done but the news reporters give the results directly. Their debates have no base, they just create statements that come from their sources without any proofs and create a mess around the country with false news, they just want more TRPs. They have a very good viewership so I request them to be factual, genuine, and try spreading news which helps our country grow."
RepublicTV,Lodhu channel..godi media,1,Channel of axxxhxxxx... Mindless people watch this bekar chx  Channel... M hindu but hate their propoganda..news.. ARNAB BAUSWAMI..bau bau

RepublicTV,Revenge is not a solution,3,Hi viewers we all know about indian media  channels about their trp stunts also now days we are seeing about trp controversy of republic tv with Mumbai police but according to me I think that mumbai police just want to take revenge with Arnab for everything which happened with them and Maharashtra Government it is totally political pressure also I am not in full support of media channels as they are forgetting their duties but as compared to other fake journalist Arnab is better.
RepublicTV,It is very shouting,3,This is very nice channel than others and also this is the beautiful graphics because of that looks very good and gorgeous
RepublicTV,Fake,1,Fake and discrimanatory news in this channel they only show the news that contain hate and discrimination and they think that they are judge
RepublicTV,Review about republic tv,1,"This is so much cringy , and here violence is sxsisted in many forms , and tha anchors and hosts shouts very loudle , their talks and argues did not make any sense and this show is very biased , the main formality of media is to ask the questions to the government but usually they always praise government and instead of asking questions to government they asks questions to the opposition, and sometimes theybare spreading the communal violence cox the debate between hindu and muslim is not necessary"
RepublicTV,Good News Channel,5,"This channel looks like the truth, the rest of the channels are not sold like this, they raise the voice of the public.It is the only channel in the country that understands the problems of the public."
RepublicTV,Ban Republic TV,1,This Channel should be banned because the content showed on this channel is misleading the people of country and there is only non sense being displayed. The major effect of the content of this channel are only targeting some specific religion and not showing equality to all
RepublicTV,An EMPTY VESSEL that SOUNDS LOT!,1,"He was once seen so versatile. He came into forefront anchoring the Great Indian Circus called the Parliament n State Assembly Election news of the country. Had been so straight, kniving to see the depths of any1, undeterred. To bring out the truth. But not now. Why? What went in btw? To stoop so low! Is it that just the bucks matter now? Just the fluttering of the currency papper counts? Heart-rendering! turned out to be ""AN EMPTY VESSEL"" that ""SOUNDS A LOT""!"
RepublicTV,Banned or Not banned review this channel,1,I think it is not public TV because public are not satisfied this news channel this is Bad channel issued by public so banned or not this will be decided positive and negative Review both of count by channel if most public are satisfied this channel then it's should not be banned and if more public are not satisfied this news channel then it can be banned by government so my review is banned this type channel if more public are not satisfied

RepublicTV,Republic tv,3,That is brave tv channel across India every one Knows arnab goswami is the most brave host and honour of tv channel.i like this channel very much.atnab Goswami its my favourite host
RepublicTV,Should Focus on important matters,3,"I think Republic TV should talk about important matters! Republic TV should have been debate about . Education, GDP, farmers strike but unfortunately they were busy with sushat, rhea, nepotism in bollywood! Republic TV proved that only TRP matters, it's a entertaining channel nothing else! Electronic media has the power to spread the genuine news within a minute but Republic TV hide the important facts and spread hatered, And Arnav shouldn't shout on guest they call for a debate."
RepublicTV,Godi Channel!,1,"I would share my thoughts about this channel. First this channel always broadcaste useless content on their channel that is only based on actors such as Susant Singh Rajput and always showing postive side of BJP. I am also fan of Susant Singh Rajput but showing content all time about his not a fair thing, becasue this channel not focusing on news just focus on TRP. No dobut, many renowned channels also doing same such as ABP news, Zee News, but Republic TV is number one in this matter. I will suggust to TV viewers that dont waste your time by watching this useless channel."
RepublicTV,Awsome news channel,3,This is the only channel who fought for sushant singh rajput I really like this channel speacially the way arnab ghoswami he is just awosome one of the best news chanel in india. They are doing really great work also the whole team behind the screen they are just awsome I only watch this channel they have the best debate show specially arnab he too good in that also the way he expose bollywood mafia thats great he have the best anchors and the team behind them are just too good. Republic tv u just too good keep it up Thank you
RepublicTV,Yes I want to ban this channel,1,"This channel is not showing reality, Republic TV is showing unnecessary news, with no proof so that's why I suggested to ban Republic Tv, channel CEO is corrupt, and already he got police case, Republic Tv continue sprayed wrong information about Maharashtra and Maharashtra CM Udhav Thackeray and hes political party Shivsena, Republic Tv is taking Money from BJP to sprayed wrong information about the Maharashtra State and Maharashtra Government, everytime this channel support wrong things, and sprayed wrong information that's why I wish to Ban Republic Tv channel"
RepublicTV,Truth of news,4,I dont even think that before republic tv I had watch any news channel which shows the truth than this channel such a lovely channel I prefer all my freinds neighbourhood and parents to see only this tv channel because I dont think that in our social media any channel is there in the line of republic tv it shows every top to the bottom news regarding farmers soldiers our country and many more things today I am writing this review because I seriously love this news channel very much I hope this  channel will be same as now thankyou
RepublicTV,I'm a biggest fan of this channel,3,"I'm biggest fan of this channel and all the respected anchors And other members associated with this channel especially Mr. Arnab Goswami sir because he is ideal for me . Nowadays this channel plays a very important guiding role to the biggest democratic republic country the greatest cuture subcontinent India. This channel provides only true news and aware people from any type of crime or fraud . I like this chhanel so much. And my favourite shows on this channel is ""Puchhta h bharat "" with Arnab Goswami sir ."
RepublicTV,Review of R Bharat,4,"Takes real news in front of public, good channel but little more aggressive.need to maintain balance between josh and hosh.an important thing is that they cover whole screen with written news and less for video screen.In my opinion its a good news channel that needs a little improvement."
RepublicTV,R bharta,1,Its a very cheap channel it gives a fraud information to public. It has to be baned .R bharat makes lots of disappointment in paublic related to rigion like hindu muslim. Arnab Goswami is able for punishment
RepublicTV,R Bharat,2,In my opinion this news channel has been focusing only on one thing rather than others things. There are many other issues happening but they were not focusing on that and hosts and anchors are overreacting and also loud .
RepublicTV,TRP OF REPUBLIC TV,1,Worst of the worse News Channel. It is not a news channel but it is a platform of spreading communal discord and a propaganda of one particular political party.
RepublicTV,Sometimes overreacted,1,"I think it's a worst channel. Before many days ago I just watching there only Rhea or SSR matter it's only for TRP. There is a lot of problems but they didn't notice that kind of problems like flood of assam flood of Bihar etc. They only show their Amitabh, and other celebrities life."
RepublicTV,News,3,This news channel is give write information and all news are fast and not fake so I love it to much political news is good keep it up
RepublicTV,Yes we stand for arnab goswami,5,Arnab goswami is one of the best anchor and host of india who always try to give us true news and also let us about day to day life and what is happening around us.
RepublicTV,No bcoz it is helping a family to know the truth.,4,It should not ban becoz it is helping to know that what happened to shushant sing rajput and also helping us to know that what is bollywood actually.
RepublicTV,Dangerous,5,"This is a really good decision It is wrong for you to grow the top.where the meter is installed, you are giving 5 hundred rupees to it. You used to do that to watch the same channel for everyday Forever banned in this channel Urnab fakht marathi , box cinema banned"
RepublicTV,My republic tv,5,This is the indias most important factor because rebublic tv shows us very important things that we enjoying repulic tv also helps to provide great information to people. Republic tv provide us good news of politics as well as sports so I think this is the most popular chanales in our india. Republic tv help people for fight with correption and all other things that why every indian people loves republic tv so much
RepublicTV,Very bad,1,"This channel do very bad to get trp by pay money. For this activity government take very big decisions over this type of channel. I think this type of activity get very loss to other channel like ajjtak , geenews ect . Because through TRP decided to get advertisement. Those channel whose trp is more than advertisements get more than other channel. So trp is very important for tv channel. I think goverment decided trp all over the india. So not possible to get trp by pay money. In this channel Republic TV only so copy news and not good news."
RepublicTV,Yes It Should be,1,What people can do for TRP. It is a good example of it. Why these people don't think about poverty and falling economy of our country. Why they only shout like an ediot. Does shouting means it all. Getting TRP is the only business now. Its sad that our media has a face like this. Its media who can make a chnage in community. So be a guidng light for the mass. Not a shouting star. Be a star of people's heart. May they get their inner side cleaned and show only what is true. It requires courage to present truth not money.
RepublicTV,Trustworthy Channel,5,Republic world is that media network which always reveals the truth of the world and about serious crimes. so for the purpose of denunciation Mumbai government and his police try there best. But no one can suppressed the voice of truth. and I am pretty sure about republic TV that they can't hike there RTP in illicit manner. so everyone those who are the not interested in arnab Debate. and say that his Debate is not more than shouting. so I would like to tell them that if everyone against you then what should you do? and arnab your show Nation wants to know. Today Nation with you. Thank you @Mouthshut ?? Give me a opportunity to explore my sentiment. .
RepublicTV,Empty vessels make more noise,1,"Personally I am not a fan of Arnab Goswami. He's little more outspoken than he should be. I feel his journalism is completely biased. The way he humiliates other people on his studio, he needs better ethics and moral science in his life. And the way he distracted the whole audience of India from major problems like downfall of GDP, the three destructive bills for farmers, I don't think he's doing justice to the profession journalism. Tampering of TRP has been on air recently, I think ArGo can go to any heights to buy TRP. However I would like to say, anyone is innocent until proven guilty."
RepublicTV,Best news channel,5,R. Bharat is my favourite news channel Reason. Brave reporters Very good news quality SSR case Exposing bolliwood Exposing Mumbai police Exposing Antino mayno In my view R. Bharat should not ban we require this type of patriotic news channel
RepublicTV,Bad news reporting.,1,"Hello, Today I want to say something about the famous news channel ""Republic TV"". I don't know from where they get so much talent for telecasting worst and fake news. Hatsoff to ""Arnab Goswami"" for storing so much talent on fake journalism. On the otherhand we all know that ""Republic TV"" was became India's most-watched hindi news channel. In terms of TRP ""Republic TV"" is on number 1. Some reports say that many ""Republic TV"" journalism resigned and says that they talked about nepotism but their news channel whole runs under Arnab's wife, rest of the journalism has not even have any rights to say something excess reports. They don't have any independent on reporting. Anchors and host of this news channel is very offensive. Although, I told it previously. They just shouting, shouting and shouting and the Arnab's motto ""The nation wants to know"" is very famous. That's all it's a home of garbage it just put violence and negativity in our mind. Good to know that there channel was getting banned. Thank you."
RepublicTV,Arnab is the king of all news news channel,5,"Republic tv is the best out there, it's the only tv that reveals lies and curruption. Hats off to you Arnab Goswami and republic."
RepublicTV,Only for Aranb.,1,Shame on him.. Biased journalist. actually he is not journalist.. he continues his Chanel for debate for particular political party.
RepublicTV,Where is the news?,1,"The whole schedule is focused on SSR case and vilify one individual. There no news literally on the channel, it's a news channel running a complete drama for entertainment. There are so many issues being faced by the country today, pandemic, a degrowing economy, rise in religion based discrimination, rift with china etc and not one is being put forth."
RepublicTV,This channel repesents ONE NATION ONE VOICE ..??,3,Always they show truth and not sacared of any one fighting justice for anyones ex.nowdays they are asking justice for sushant singh rajput and like to salute them.??
RepublicTV,Very bad and unwanted channel.,1,Why your every anchor shout like any thing. You may talk in low voice also. Hearing your every anchor feels like irritating. We do not like the faces of Arnab goswami and other anchors during anchoring. If you people continue the same thing very soon no one will like your channel. I personally become irritate and due to the behaviour of your anchors I do not like to see your channel.
RepublicTV,Mouth Piece of BJP,1,This is the mouth piece of BJP.  It's anchor Arnab Goswami is a complete nonsense. For comedy one can watch this channel.
RepublicTV,THE BEST NEWS CHANNEL,5,I have been watching Republic Tv since the death of SSR. This channel has been so supportive for the justice and for the truth we all want to know. They have been working day and night to solve the SSR case. I really appreciate Arnab Gosami for all the efforts he takes. We need more journalists like him and more news channels like Republic bharat. After being so inspired by them and their work. I downloaded their app in my phone... if you really want to watch news and know whats going on outside in this world then Republic Tv is the best.
RepublicTV,Worst ever anchor.,1,"Is there's a way to ban Arnab, I hate this guy journalism. There are lot of new to show but this guy seem like closed in his own box."
RepublicTV,Bakwas,1,All Anchors are useless. Only they are making Noise. I think they don't know how to deliver News. They all are Journalists?
RepublicTV,King in the field of Media,5,The Republic TV is the best news channel in India. They are true to their work and do not give fake news. The channel is doing very well with Mr Arnab Goswami in the helm of things . He is a genius. The channel is trying its best to give justice to Sushant Singh Rajput. He Channel also did a great job in the Sheena Bora murder case .
RepublicTV,The only unbiased news channel,5,The only channel that is not serving the purpose of politicians and is not afraid of showing the truth. Kudos to Arnab for his great journalism
RepublicTV,Mr,5,"This is so nice Chanel,  true  news  comes always and all are brave anchors. God bless to Arnab Goswami"
RepublicTV,News or Nautanki channel?,1,"It doesn't give any sense of giving news to the public! Always aggressive, shouting and giving the judgement. Looks more like Nautanki!"

RepublicTV,Really amazing news channel,3,Republic channel always support truth and spatially in debate arnab goswami sir who stand with truth and kind of question ask by him to criminal is amazing sir I love your all debate sir. Your confidence speech contain truth support
RepublicTV,Unpleasant and disturbing,1,Aranb debate is always biased and very unpleasant to hear. He always acts like above the authority . Only he pushes his agenda and views by screaming and allows only to speak those who support his views. He interupts and doesn't allow to talk those who have opposite views .Being the anchor he must listen to all and leave it to the public to decide instead of giving his verdicts.
RepublicTV,Worst Debate Channel,1,"If anyone still watching R Republic pls a big salute to you. Seriously, Arnab is so loud without any reason...there is no system or process of debate. Someone should tell him that Debate doesn't mean to shout, loud voice, and talking in between others talk. Bhai samjhne to do what one person is saying...kisika kuch sunai de to samjh aye na...I really don't have any issue with news channel or Anchor but my problem is the way they present their debate shows  Bakwas debate, No process , No system , Nothing just loud ..i think school Students can do much better debate than this channel or anchor. And pls stop using tag line Puchta h Bharat...It's not people ask it's only u want to earn your ratings. Worst Channel"
RepublicTV,Worst News Channel,1,"Hello everyone today I am going to share my experience about Republic channel I have watched this channel two or more time but I will tell you, folks, this is the worst new channel that I have watched this tv channel only knows to spread hatred and nothing else the news is always based on the basis of caste that is no proper news always targeting the minority India is a peace-loving country but because of such news channel the dignity and harmony of this country is going down day by day The host and anchors are not at all good they don't know how to do Journalism Arnab Goswami is the worst he doesn't know how to respect the people invited on the channel if anyone whats to say anything he just doesn't allow you to speak SO please everyone stop watching such pathetic news channel as this news channel will have an impact on your mind"

RepublicTV,Very biased and worst ever news channel,1,Not sure why they male up lies and stories....misleading a lot of people by air giving wrong info. Some times the host manages the volume by techmolgy for people who is not in alignment. This is hopless host
RepublicTV,Views on Journalism,1,The Republican TV when was created it clearly shown the biasness initially itself at the beginning sometimes the Channel runs those topics which are quite irrelevant and not related to Peoples life and their needs and Many a times the opinion the channel which they called their self opinion its actually not all the decisions and opinions or the point of view they make actually favours the government more they are pro -Centre government and sometimes act like a puppet for them they are really really quite prejudiced Channel.
RepublicTV,All news is biased in one way or another,3,"Some people claim it all like biased news, sorry but all news is biased in one way or another absolutely and possibly and I do want to get going with that by leaving my review here. Too much of hate and nonsense also present there anyway."
RepublicTV,Arnab is best.,3,"I have bee  following this channel since its conception.  I like the way plotes are made and information is given. Point to point debate is there in group chat and truth is always try to be revealed everything single time. I prefer this channel because it is not biased and giving best efforts  to give details. It is not even in the fever of any political party and hence, it is my favourite  channel."
RepublicTV,Jamat,5,Best tv news and nothing to beat all anchors. Specially arnab.

RepublicTV,Worst channel ever,1,Runs goverment propangada. The main anchor is baised . He ask  childish questions from the government and blames the opposition.
RepublicTV,Fake news and worst reporting,1,This channel should be banned. It does not honor even the basic rules of journalism. The only agenda is to put across what BJP wants to say and then make sure that it stands true and nobody is able to challenge that. I have seen numerous occasions when the reporter actually nods and repeats what the person from BJP is saying. Sometimes it's so funny that their reporters completely forget that the basic role of the reporter is to just report.
RepublicTV,Great reporters,5,Great channel...great reporters...I feel the loyalty for the country ...Arnab is great ...lion of India. Keep it up ??
RepublicTV,It is no more english news channel,3,"More than 40 percent telecaster in hindi, in prime time debate also more than 50 percent hindi .They launched republic bharath for hindi audiences.This channel has become hindi english mixed news channel, there by losing merit of english news channel and quality detoriating due to excess hindi.South india is maximum viewer of english news channel, from our point of view we no more enjoy your channel.

This channel must be banned. stupid news and baseless topics are run on this channel. The anchor never allow oposition party to speak.

RepublicTV,This channel should be banned,1,Spreading fake news media is fourth pillar of democracy and this channel is threatening please everybody support to take this channel down supporting specific political party is not good everybody unsubscribe  republic TV and republic bharat if not this is going down
RepublicTV,"Cheap, undeserving person.",1,"He shouts and lies at the same time. Indian media must be cleaned of such cheap people who are spreading hatred and intolerance like a cancer, due to the money poured by politicians like BJP. I feel omitting when I accidentally come to see him. Such tendencies want to capture the power and control other's lives by using fake nationalism."
RepublicTV,Republic TV and the saffron Nationalism,4,"Republic TV is an English News Channel of India with it's headquarter based in Mumbai. Recently it has also launched it's Hindi Channel Republic Bharat due to the demands from the Hindi speaking viewers of Republic brand. This channel is owned by Asia.net medias and it's promoter is TV news prime time journalists Arnab Goswami Who was previously a senior news Editor for the TV channel TimesNow. This Republic channel has been recently launched and on the very opening of this channel it created a huge controversy by exposing Congress MP Sashi Tharoor and the same year a report published by the Broadcasting media state that this channel was was viewed by the highest number of people in the country. Nowadays we often notice that some section of people openly criticise and have also discarded this channel. Arnab the editor seems to be a sympathiser of the Saffron party Ideology, and the opposition keeps on saying that Republic TV is a Bjp financed channel and Arnab being a journalists acts like a karyakarta of Bjp. This is the point of views of one section of people which includes the liberals, Independent thinkers, Leftists and the so called the Liberal Democrats. There is another section of people who are the sympathisers of Rightists ideology Group, and treat this channel as the best media TV channel in the Asia Continent. Whaichever ideologies follow it or not but the ultimate truth is, Arnab Goswami has been succeed to make this channel one among the best News channel in India. Different people have different views, and every one is correct as per his own view, . The prime time show at 9p.m is conducted by Arnab Goswami himself and is often seen to be speaking in a higher tonee, after all these are all scripted for The rise of TRP. On it's foundation day Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself attended the show and spoke about the contributions of media in a Democracy and also said the country is changing under BJP Govt and it is not an old India but a young new India. Most of the reputed personalities attended the show including kamal Hassan, Smriti Irani, Nitin Gadkari, Baba Ramdev. For the better expansion of democratic principles which are considered as the soul of Indian politics, we need Leftists, Rightists, liberals etc. Each of them have their own significant role in making the democratic values of our country more wider. I follow Republic TV as well as NDTV. For me both the medias are doing extremely well in the contemporary period. The only thing they need to improve is to include the issues of Northeast India in their Prime time debate topic, because they are most seen to be focussed on the central main land of India. I request the viewers to be neutral and watch like a viewers rather than a political party follower, ."
RepublicTV,Worst anchoring,1,Worst news channel ever I'm seen .bulshit news.....And anchoring .    Clearly shows that the channel is working for a particular party. It's not All about republic or democrate . Please stop this and Get the step for reality. Jai hind jai bharat
RepublicTV,Just news with drama discussion,1,Most of speclated drama and discussion with no proper solution in this tv. Balokot news was hyped  somtimes. Speading useless news in discussion where no where the party blame on each other. Not active journalism its pupet show fun to watch bla bla...
RepublicTV,Journalism at its worst,1,"Too loud and noisy news channel. Shameless supporters of BJP. If your brain and heart has been sold you can watch this channel. But this channel will appeal to the majority in the country as the majority is downright stupid, moronic idiots. Thank god this nonsense is not in Hindi and influencing more moronic people."
RepublicTV,Garbage news channel,1,"I said it all in the title...well watch the channel for just few mins in the evening debate with their main anchor and you would realise what I mean...even one star is too much. Journalism taking strange forms in this channel, well someone needs to teach them the very basics of journalism"
RepublicTV,Worst english TV Channel,1,Their Episode Debate is so chaotic. Crowd of speakers and anchor shouting. Viewers are unable to listen properly. Debate are mostly inconclusive in the end. Better they remain a normal news channel and stop such debates. Wastage of viewers time. One feels pitting Tv off a
RepublicTV,Stop bullshit Arnab,1,"Channel for hatred, communal riots..dear Indians please try to avoid to see this channel seriously..it is only open to spread divide and rule amongst us.We Indian can we stop to watch these kind of news...which doesn't  hold any innovation information.News should be based on reality and evidence..."
RepublicTV,Poor channel,1,Fake news only generating. Bad presentation spreading fake news. Always trying to separate the people in the name of cast. Just felt like follow the command from RSS. In the term of republic TV cow is more expensive than human life. Trying to divide our country in various aspects.
RepublicTV,About Debut,3,"This debut is worthless as we canâ€™t hear the presenter nor the people taking part in debut. And these Congress lovers are shouting like dogs. There should be system where only one person is allowed when chance to speak is given. I would say this channel is giving true headlines. I like  presenter Arnav  Goswami, who is fair."
RepublicTV,Harmful for professionals,1,Once returned from the days work the shouting/noise is very bad for mental health. I had to block the channel as per advice of a counselor. I used to be a big fan and in 2008-09 I introduced Times Now's show to many friends in Bengaluru and they all appreciated. Off late that unnecessary noise became disturbing. Viewers don't get any useful information about the country or environment. Gone are the days of shouting matches every evening on trivial issues between the same set of people. There is neither outdoor reporting nor any analysis on pressing issues. For reality show I will prefer Big Boss of WWF!
RepublicTV,Good South India ignored,3,"Arnab sir, when u started the channel , I heard u promising that  South India will not be ignored, well u r not ignoring but u r covering only the bad politics of states, latest was Sabarimala Why don't you interview great philanthropists like Sudhamurthy, AjimPremji etc etc who have joined hands in building metro, flyovers, schools and what not .They are such an inspiration for the youth.Instead we see only Mallya or dirty Karnataka politics everyday, we are sick of this .Good work never gets highlighted , For that matter even JRD Tata, Anand Mahindra , we as self employed cant get a chance to hear any inspirational speeches , we depend on the channels but it is unfortunate bad news wins over good work, can u focus n this pls, regards"
RepublicTV,Worst news channel in the world,1,Arnab goswami is slave of bjp.He always shows the news which satisfies bjp.He thinks hes the hitler of his channel.He shouts on each and every person seating there.This channel should be banned as every person who attends the news are anoyyed of Arnab as he doesnt allow others to speak.It seems Arnab as spoke person of bjp.
RepublicTV,King of the worst news channels-Republic Tv,1,"Republic channel is the king of the worst news channels in India. The channel presenter, Arnab Goswami acts like a dictator. He is not giving any time for the debaters to express their opinions. He doesn't listen to them and won't let them speak. I think this is not the way you should behave in front of the camera. I am rating it the least I can but if I could, I would rate it 0 stars. Do not watch this news channel because it is a disgrace to our country."
RepublicTV,Worst Channel in India,1,Replibic tv is the one of the worst news channel in India.their programmes are telecasting for only promoting values of ruling party of the country.in the political debate the main news anchor Arnab goswami wonâ€™t ready to listen who are participating from other political parties leaders.its absolutely bad experience to watch the channel
RepublicTV,Worst,1,They run this channel only to slam their views on others. Not ready to listen what others have to say. Worst is when they reduce the mic volume of the opposing speaker so that he can shout like anything. This is unacceptable especially in case of a news channel. WORST!
RepublicTV,BJP Mouth-piece,1,"Journalists must stand for justice. Don't represent one Political party. And you guys, specially Arnab acting like A stupid. He's not giving any opportunity to talk. He wants the guests  speak what he requires. Then why the hell you guys Invite people with different opinions. It's not journalism it's Slavery to BJP n Modi"
RepublicTV,Political Party(BJP)  channel,1,"Unethical and corrupted channel.A BJP supporting party not a republic tv.should change the name from republic TV to BJP TV.a man with common sense can understand the ethics of the channel when you see the interview of arnab with modi.its kinda like we go for a wiva exam after receiving the question paper a day before the exam.agenda of the channel ""is support BJP only"""
RepublicTV,Malayali...,1,"I love my Kerala for its diversity and unity at the same. Though we fight for the silliest of the reason we are bunch of strong hearts when in need #ProudToBeMalayali.Poda Mona aranab goswami.Kerala has a unique quality that India, nay, the world still struggles to achieve. Multiculturalism. It is culturally diverse and yet at the same time socially unified. But what do we mean when we throw around words like diverse and unified? In terms of diversity, Kerala has the most varied religious composition with roughly 30% Muslims, 20% Christians and 50% Hindus and yet the instances of communal violence arethe lowest compared to any other state in India"
RepublicTV,Baap of biased news.,1,Very very true bhakth channel. Looks like its corrupted News channel as many says. Only spend time in backing governament and its stand with out much questions on any pros or cons of governament stands. Its not News channel its advertisement channel of BJP.

Worst news reporting channel ever. Mr. Arnab, I never seen such a culture less behavior with any other journalist in our country like you. A worst channel running with most stupid guy in the world. King of lair and senseless idiot. If google will provide minus  star rating option I will definitely give my wish rating, @ moment I do not have other option so giving 1 star rating which they do not deserve."
RepublicTV,Completely mocked up views and provocative channel,1,"This is a sponsored channel to present views from a pre-determined angle thus mocking the nation, its people and the constitution. There has to a law to investigate blatant lies and antinational views presented by Arnab Goswami and his team. He got a mileage when he started to strike a chord with people initially, now he is using that mileage to present mutilated statements fooling people for sponsored political parties. His views on KERALAFLOODS is totally unacceptable and trying to disorient people with good hearts will stand united for genuine tragedy such as Kerala flood in Future."
RepublicTV,Our Malayali is enter different from other state,1,Mr Assami don’t do your idiotic comments to Kerala people Malayali is different from other state you should comment after think and do our level is different don’t play mallus okk and South Indian people we are not Sangi and Modi fans you are really in trap
RepublicTV,My opinion on republic tv,1,"Republic TV lost it’s face by commenting on Kerala floods without analysing the facts. Arnab doesn’t not have any right to call others anti nationals. Whom he called a group of bitches and shamesless. He should make it clear. If he is mentioning about the Kerala politicians, don’t forget that they are elected by the common people who have demonstrated a high standard of tolerance"
RepublicTV,Sub standard TV,1,"The channel itself is partial and paid media of corporates and controlled by corrupt politicians I don't know where they are getting money for the dividing activities, how shameless people they are going behind cow ignoring people's safety and minimum standard of living he is part of shameful bunch of corrupt Journalists"
RepublicTV,Arnab goswamy  on keralites,1,"Arnab viswam is a biased man. He is spreading hatred among people.

Terrible show, funny attitude. overall, this show sound like you are in a market place and many a times, unable to make out anything due to multiple people talking at the same time. It is totally disgusting to see the bossy attitude of the anchor!"
RepublicTV,Masala and Tons of proxy nationalism,1,"Attacking a geography is something stupid. In fact, it's heights of ignorance and absurdity. I'm confused how it could be a news channel. Get well soon arnub. Political orientation is not a single. But political blindness is kinda porn. I'm seriously confused how this guy sleeps at night after all these lies."

RepublicTV,Hatred,1,"4th estate plays a very crucial role in bringing federal harmony in India. It should shoulder concrete role in linking every nook and corner of this country, chain the great people of different diversity, correcting the system in every aspects, be totally impartial in its messages. One could see the allegation by Mr Goswamy against great people of Kerala at this juncture as an attempt to bring down the morale of the entire 3.5 crore people when they unanimously fighting  the fury of nature. Rather terming them as "" shameless people', he could have address them "" people of great determination"" ."

RepublicTV,Real Gutsy News Channel,5,"Republic changed the way channel report the news. When there was only one way of reporting by NDTV, ABP News, India Today(I.e. paid twisted fake corrupt news) Republic brought correct and factual news to your drawing room. The bad rating here reflects the hold of Congress Social Media agents who might not even have cable TV connection but providing their reviews . Republic can definitely alter their ways of presenting their debating, make it less noisy, however the content is factual than rehearsed."

Constantly conducting debates on uncertain topics to create conspiracies and thereby Breakout conflicts between people. This channel earns money by creating issues in the debate . The main anchor Mr Arnab Goswami let down the nation . He has forgot his dignity towards is profession , professionalism and towards the people of India . We can understand his intention to create conspiracies in his debates also. He never allows fellow members in the debate to complete what they are trying to say . And when the time comes to speak here is a sound and starts blabbing his predetermined decisions and observations. I think government should Ban this media channel for reporting and spreading conspiracy send fake news ."
RepublicTV,Worst channel ever.ban it.,1,"I don't think it deserves even a single star. I installed the app only to write this review. It's a highly biased politically motivated channel. All the fanatic opinions coming out of Arnab and the channel are the words of sanghaparivar who eat crowdung and drink gomoothra.

RepublicTV,Most bullshit Anchor I've ever seen!!,1,"Mr. Arnab Goswami, how dare you to speak against a state like this. If you have any particular political agenda, do not try to take it out against keralites. We have different Views & opinion but we will gather for our culture, tradition, values and common interests."
RepublicTV,Rated X,1,Never seen such a biased TV channel ever. The support of the ruling government makes it easy for Arnab to run the puppet show. This channel instruments in planting fear and hatred within Indians that can be utilized as votes in favor of BJP. Media is not the forth pillar anymore with such media companies in existence in modern India.
RepublicTV,Humility is a sign of maturity.,1,Humbles are accepted and respected every where. All the  deep rooted trees will be ruined  one day. Nothing is forever. Changes may take place. Shouting too much is really irritative. Atleast once in a year take rest and ask others to speak and give their views.
RepublicTV,The worst indian news channel,1,"Mr.Arnab Goswami, such a heartless person, kept on doing his bloody politics, not even considering the people who lost homes at kerala.He doesnt know how harmful his words are.how hate he has created towards kerala from other states of india.He doesnt what kerala is all about. How people live here."
RepublicTV,Spread anti national statement,1,Very biased and anchoring beeing below par. Debate is been shown as one man show their in the participant are subject to high volume than sensible talk. More pathetic is beeing choice of topic. Selection of topic has to be more relating to current affairs and devopment of the country. Rather it should not be celibrity personal stuff. 3rd rated retarded channel more presisly paid one
RepublicTV,Offenceive comments on a state,1,"Arnab gosamis's Horrible comments on Kerala and malayalees during this devastated situation in a public debate. A well educated man should not use such kind of comments on a group, cast or Creed. This shows that Education is not the base of maturity but wisdom."
RepublicTV,Bad,1,They are spreading partiality. Supporting a political group. Speaking against the most noble community in the country. We cant support it. Please dont support them. We like keralites. We use to watch good channels. But cant support this type of channels
RepublicTV,Worst News channel ever,1,The most biased news channel ever. Arnab Goswami is the best bootlicker. The channel circulates BJP's agenda and never reports any  failures of BJP. If it starts to report BJP'S failures it will have time only to do that. The worst part is that the it is a hate manufacturing machine.
RepublicTV,Stop Barking you idiot arnab.,1,Why the hell are you barking arnab?. you are such a shameless animal ever seen . you better stop pointing on we Keralates . Arnab should be taken out the media in fact from India.these kind of people are shameful for India. The most worst channel of India would be yours.
RepublicTV,#republic,1,Agenda based channel. Not showing current issues.better to start a comedy channel insteadof this.i don't know how people are entertaining this guy and his comedy. Arnab cow swamy is doing it for his god fathers.He does not know the culture of keralites.
RepublicTV,Worst and Biased,1,Highly biased channel.They just try to propogate their political ideologies rather than unweiling the truth.They hide facts and give u uncooked rice after which the viewer will be in a political dilema.Will such a channel will be an asset to the nation.Worst I would say.
RepublicTV,BJP biased channel,1,It's pathetic. Arnab isn't bringing up any current issues nor is he questioning the current government about their actions or the lack of it. He is an unethical journalist who is nothing but a loud abusive bully who shouts to make a point! Arnab is not only biased and prejudiced journalist but also a hypocrite. The only thing you can get from his debate is plenty of entertainment and you will never get bored. Republic channel can be considered as an entertainment channel rather than a news channel.
RepublicTV,Manipulated news spreading channel,1,This is worst news channel focused on sprinkling hatred among people of India by throwing fake news in favour of a particular Party. Arnab cowsamy is a unofficial spokesman of BJP. This is worst news channel focused on sprinkling hatred among people of India by throwing fake news in favour of a particular Party. Arnab cowsamy is a unofficial spokesman of BJP. Republic TV is the worst channel I have ever seen in my life.
RepublicTV,Cow swami vs Kerala,1,This begger is not qualified for this job bcos he just a barking dog for political parties in India. U r no one to judge about kerala and our culture.

RepublicTV,Very Bad...,1,The don't know the value of media. they don't have the scientific temper. partial news. they act like BJP's media goonda. they don't have any commitment to the nation and nation-building. In that sense they are traitors. very very bad performance. they have no interest in the nation's progress. very very very RIGHT political view.
RepublicTV,Poor Channel,1,"Hello friends, Today I am going to review the TV CHANNEL REPUBLIC TV. They says that it's an journal but I haven't seen any kind of useful and real news I these channel they makes the real newses comfortable to their prior and gives the audience an false or fake information about the incident. These channel motivates and enriches only some kind of political party and they move according to their wishes. That's why this channel is not people friends channel they mislead the audience from the real fact behind every incidents and portraits only what they need. We cannot depend this type of channels for real new and updates these are full of spam and irrelevant contents. And some advertisements ethic is favorable to them. Anyway I personally never promote such croked channels and nerve refer to someone. MY RATING ON THIS CHANNEL IS 1.5/5 THANKYOU"
RepublicTV,Fake and biased news,1,It's a Politically motivated news channel which acts like a BJP's mouth piece there is no honest journalism in this channel but in fact just spreading fake news and hate amoung Indians. And debates are only selected for political gains and lots of shouting in debates.
RepublicTV,English channel fit for watching debates,4,"When Arnab Goswami launched this channel after seperation from Times Now. Everybody was very skeptical about its future, which has been proven wrong.  Although some people say that this channel favours a particular party but I do not think so. Since every spokesperson are given fair chance to present  their views. Only backdraw is that only two program at 9 and 10 PM  ate worth watching."
RepublicTV,Well I never liked it one bit.,1,Well I never liked it one bit. Its just too biased in favor of tone political party . Many people are all shouting in the debate together just like a fish market. Cant hear anything at all. The host throws his weight around all the time. They don't really respect the views of other people. Only the Host's views are most important. Wont watch it again.
RepublicTV,Biased,1,"Biased and paid news channel. Shame to jouranalism. Simply support BJP and their agendas. Attack on Shashi tharoor shows the worst side of Republic. Funded by BJP people, no wonder behind the BJP biasing. Arnab never allows anyone to talk, he assumes he is super intelligent."
RepublicTV,More voice less news,2,Republic is now almost a year old english news channel.It is started by arnab goswami.I do not like to watch this channel because most of the subject of the debate and news are politically motivated and it is more like a promotion channel.Apart from this he calls 10 15 guests together for debate! Everyone speaks together including thie anchor and eventually viewers can not hear anything! Watch it only if no other news channel are available in your set top box otherwise there are so many far better and real news centric english news channels available.
RepublicTV,Spreads hatred &  communal tension among citizens,1,"I have been watching the shows hosted by Arnab Goswami for quite sometime. He is very much pro BJP, creating tension between diverse community in the name of Journalism. He just shouts& never lets anyone answer his questions. Such a pathetic news channel. The channel doesn't telecast the real problems of citizens, instead telecasts the ones that might create hate crimes between Hindus, Muslims& Christians. Shame on republic TV. Shame to Journalism"
RepublicTV,Good News,3,It shows pretty good debates and news headlines .It has become very famous lately due to arnab goswami. He also has many shows like the Patriot and People's show which is conducted on his channel. These shows are pretty good to watch and have a lot of facts to show .Also he conducted a special program on the republic day which was amazing.
RepublicTV,NEWS HOUR PROGRMS,5,"I HAVE BEEN WATCHING REPUBLIC TV SINCE ITS INCEPTION. IT IS A TREAT TO WATCH THIS CHANNEL FOR ITS SHEER BRILLIANCE. WHEN BRIGADE AFTER BRIGADE ARE FINDING FAULT WITHOUT ANY BASE AND MOUNT THEIR ENTIRE CRITICISM SPEWING VENOM, ANCHOR LIKE ARNAB WILL EFFECTIVELY NEUTRALIZE THE BAD EFFECTS BY PRODUCING STUNNING HARD FACTS! THE RESEARCH TEAM OF ARNAD IS REALLY GOOD. HIS COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND VOICE MODULATION ARE SIMPLY SUPERB. PLEASE CONTINUE THIS BUT SEE THAT THE PANEL MEMBERS DO NOT SHOUT. DESPITE YOUR 3 REQUESTS, IF THEY CONTINUE TO SHOUT, LOWER THEIR VOLUME! THEY WILL REALIZE AND KEEP QUIET. M.J. SUBRAMANYAM, BANGALORE"
RepublicTV,Biased and Spreading Hatred,1,Channel is based on the Fake and biased propaganda. It only airs those stories which it feels can make the people in government comfortable. It ignores the real news. It is spreading hatred against a perticular section and region. It is always avoiding Real opinion.  It doesn't highlight real issues. Anchors and hosts are not good. It is doing all this just to make money. Recommendations : I hate this and strongly reject its news.
RepublicTV,Fully biased and spread fake newses!,1,This news channel is the dark side of Indian news media. This channel showed how a news media can spray fake news and false news for money. This news channel is completely biased to the ruling party of India. The founder and the chief journalist of this news channel is the most corrupted person in the Indian news media industry. This channel is a completely misleading channel and a shame on Journalism!
RepublicTV,Best news channel,5,Best news channel it helps other to know about the world host and anchors is good spoken in republic tv. They also debate in her show . I loved this news channel. They provide news very fast instantly. Every time I want to see news I come on republic tv to watch some good news . I hoped you also watch this channel to see news
RepublicTV,Awesome channel,4,Journal is considered as third pillar of democracy . It is complete work is performed by arnav goshawami he is such nice news debator that everyone in the country fear to sit him in his news panel. He only says truth don't focus on extra news . Nice news channel definitely watch this channel . It is growing rapidly . It is new news channel but one should go through this channel definitely watch it's episode .I am big fan of him. I daily watch his channel and collect lots of information . Wow
RepublicTV,Shame to journalism,1,Journalism is considered to be genuine and unbiased regarding the local parties and situations.Republic tv is no where honest and channels in government favored perspective.  Arnab is underrated anchor who needs manners and respect to the individual. Useless debates involves several people on one stage with shoutings and no way its useful for common man in any perspective.
RepublicTV,Biased Journalism,1,"Republic as the name suggests should talk about the people of this great nation India and their issues but this channel is busy with TRP sort of stuff and right from its inception, Arnab has been talking about how his channel is better than the ohers. As they say, hate sells and such has been the case with Republic TV. Arnab and other anchors are good with their work ethics but they are misusing their skills not to bring the real issues of the common people of India but to make their channel No. 1 by debating on useless topics. I have lost my interest in watching Republic TV as they claim to be the only nationlist news channel yet all they debate on is hate!"
RepublicTV,Useless debates and biased channel and reporters.,1,"Hi All, I have seen few interviews of arnab with people from multiple political parties and celebrities, and I have observed that he interviews with prejudice, he sits with a mindset with whom he is going to talk politely and with whom he need to talk aggressively and who he is not going let talk. For the specific party he applauds their moves and appreciates their efforts and he announces everything with proud whether they are true or not when you actually verify you will find half of them are false news. News channels should run unbiased news and must support only truth and justice. But they don do that, they support only power and image. If you actually wish to see the truth you better live in suspense rather than going to this channel. Thanks"
RepublicTV,Nation Wants To Know!!!,5,"I am watching Arnab Goswami debate since last couple of year. Firstly I would like to tell you this REPUBLIC TV has all top anchor and their speaking skills is great comparison to other anchor. The best thing with this channel is they mostly use advance english which is very neccessery for us, and the last but not the least Arnab goswami has talent to zap others, and I like his monolough specially  NATION WANTS TO KNOW and  NEVER EVER SAY SOMETHING AS REDICULOUS I HAVE TAKE MONEY??"
RepublicTV,Arnub taik with,5,This news channel is batter with other channel because arnab is always support on national. alway in his news headlines will be true with the proof so it will so interesting the watching the news interesting feel crazy. in other channai always to breaking news the community controversy news so we always to refer to my friend to watch this news channel .
RepublicTV,Arnab TV,3,This is purely a one man show. It's seems like whenever you watch the news u get a sense of nationalism and patriotism. Arnab's attitude of presenting the news is clearly reflected in other anchor. The Debate by Mr Arnab is the backbone of the News channel for Trp. On whole it is just a part 2 of Times Now with some more nationalism. Yes it is a little bit bias towards the BJP but not as much as NDTV to anti BJP.
RepublicTV,Biased Channel,1,As all you know arnab is one of the famous grenlatists . But he is only following stereotype news . he is a very good ancher but I would like to say all as you now he claimed something about gujrat riots but rajdeep sardesai exposed him. Apart from that he didnt felt guilty . Actually he is a genereous heart person arnab is good but I cannot support him if he will still telling lies. Please arnab come back
RepublicTV,Real hero,3,Guy  im watching him  from last  7 yeras   when he was in times now   he is great  . I truely  feel   at present republuc tv is the only and only channel which  show the real news . Republuc covers all the news  it is quite diffrent from other channel  it shows us every sports news  including kabadi etc really this thing I loved it these days I felt like cricket is the only game left the other bew channels they only broadcast about cricket . Arnab debate   u must watch  guys the questions he asks to the people in the people  relly I love him true indian
RepublicTV,Revolutionary,4,"The republic was launched under arnub gosvami after a controversial resignation of him from times now. There were rumours that the times now isn't providing thr freedom to ask questions the way he wants and thats why he redigned from their. Their were also rumours about him that one he wanted to ask questions from a politician but the times now didn't allow him to ask. So then after he resigned and decided to start his own channel which he named as Republic. The launch of the republic was a major success. They took off with a blast like revealing an audio tape related to sunanda pushkar murder case wjich again put shashi tharoor an mp of congress party into the Spotlight. And many more tapes were also released like shahabuddin talking to laloo prasad yadav, etc. These launches became the major success reason for thr channel and there hard work gained them a reasonable fruit. Now also they are wotking great on there content. The anchors and hosts are also great their accent and the way of delivery of speech is good enough to under stand easily. Other things which can be taken into consideration are their picture qualiyy and graphics which are average as it is a newly started channel but I think that they are working on it and sooner or later they will provide us with the best graphics also. So if you are an English news seeker then this can be a good otion for you."
RepublicTV,Channel Graphics are worst,1,Arnab Goswami is the one of top journalist in India.The Arnab new venture its own Republic Channel before startting the new channel I think this channel looks like international standard keep.But the channel is launched its same like others tv channels in India.If the tv screen lot of news running upside and downside runnning news almost 5news bar running.Arnab see in Small in the TV because of these bars and very poor graphics.No Standard Keeping.
RepublicTV,Channel,3,"Republic TV is the number one news channel in India. There are all type of news are available like political, sport, entertedment. And specialy important things in this are devet specialy arnab goswami debet are excellent. We are like that channel very much. And see together hole family. We all are love this channel"
RepublicTV,Best English news channel,5,"Republic Tv bangs the media industry by the sensational sting coverage of the most ever corrupted politician Mr. Lalu Prasad Yadav.His whole family taking leverage of his political career.Republic Tv exposes the many politician like Shashi Tharoor, Lalu yadav and his family, Sahabuddin and many corrupted Congress leader.Republic Tv take the media transmission to the next level.Republic Tv provides authentic news with corroboration.Arnab Goswami is best when he teaches lesson to Anti-Nationals and separatists.Yeah! He is a Pakistan's migraine."
RepublicTV,Comedy channel.,1,"Hi friends, this news channel is a comedy channel, there is no national interest news there is only a particular party's interest news. Never question about poverty, poor education system, raising unemployment. Just always do lots of nonsense thing just to please their masters. The news reports will goto any extent just to get some sensational new which cam attract more viewers."
RepublicTV,Changing news world,4,"Now a days media is observed by very differnt angle as in they gets connected with the politics of news and also with political parties. republic channel I feel under the leadership of arnab goswami possess the capabalotynto change that face of media.as far I saw arnab goswami debating and delivering news, I know he is little loud, arrogant l, ruthless as people feel but definetly one can not question his crediblity of asking questions. that is what india require now "" pure and dedicated journalism "". when journalist will do his dharma of delivering the news properly it will help in india's acceleration."
RepublicTV,Paid panelists.,1,"In today's world , you just can not rely on the news channel. They don not distribute news, they just create it. Republic TV is just another one of those news channel. The stageman here , Mr. ARNAB GOSWAMI, shouts everytime a person tries to raise a voice against him. This is not expected from a man on lime light of any news channel. Panelists mostly are paid and try to say controversial statements in order to get views from Indian audience.There have been past incidents where the panelists were kicked out from live show who stood against ARNAB. They usually try to bring topics which divide Indian population like ""BEEF BAN"" or "" TRIPLE TALAQ"" and disscuss it on ""PRIME-TIME"" news. Its just a waste of time to watch such types of channel who provide fake news and try to divide India."
RepublicTV,Paid media,1,Mr. Arnab cow chami. If someone asked u abt the rating of ur channel in fb jus tell them  you wrongly got messed with mallus and they jus make your channel rating kiss the ground. dont you ever dare to mess with a mallu comrades again.almost people hate this channel.
RepublicTV,A true and a genuine news channel,5,Hello everyone ! In the present day you will watch news what they want you to see but repuclic tv is something different .they always show you what we want to see.republic tv is not a antinational news channel .it always shows the real truth of our country .specially I love the debate hour with mr arnab goswami .he always been a good anchor and fearlless .he always shows guts in debate .he never bow down to any anitinational spirit .i always prefer republic tv because they do not run any agenda they just show the pure truth of india .
RepublicTV,"An anchor who calls a spade ""A Spade""",5,"Republic TV and its anchor Arnab is bold enough to call a spade as a spade. What Arnab exposed about the left terror in Kerala is true. The facts are always hidden or diluted by the pro-left or Jihadi channels in Kerala. Kerala is fertile ground for Islamic Terrorism. Go ahead Republic TV with your great work. If you closed observe the hate campaign against this channel, you can see he majority of guys who posted reviews are from a specific community. One reason for this is Arnab always exposed anti-nationals. Zakir Nair was exposed, John Dayal was called as conversion specilaist, Kanhya KUmar was called as anti-national. These things are not digestible for pseudo-secular and pseudo-liberals."
RepublicTV,Fake news,1,Not Realistic. Opinion about kerala was the perfect example. Do you visit kerala at least once .? If not visit before barking some thing. I am sure Mr Arnab you does not have any ethics or morality for journalism. I Think his is the first channel in India which is famous in negative review.  do you think why . because of his fake news and hidden agenda to support there founders. stop fluttering nonce's.
RepublicTV,Republic tv,5,Its one of the best TV channel .Gives sufficient information. Really a improving channel.for developingsociety and country its giving all needed information to the user at its best level.hope it will develop like this forever and helps to the society.
RepublicTV,Worst channel,1,"Totally sold out unethical, fake news spreader. Best example whatan anchor should not do. Best example how a debate should not be conducted.Over the top attitude, self fulfilling debates. Very disgusting and disturbing to see. Whenever I see Arnab cowswami.I feel like vomiting."
RepublicTV,Sold media,1,"I think the essence of journalism is raising questions which benifits the common man and not a propaganda to survive and thrive among the corroboration of power, when the epicenter of being the questioner changes to being the defender then there is no more journalism , spreding hate , big shame for arnab gowsami ."
RepublicTV,Just a bag of full of fools,1,"The whole TV stand for one specific political party . All news are based. News are portrait wrongly, and exposing wrong/false message to the viewer, for political benefits.  For my personal opinion no one view this Chanel they are not following any moral values of journalism . The channel can change there logo and name  stand as party channel, that will make sense. don't trust this channel they are just licking  ministers foot."
RepublicTV,Worst channel in the world,1,"Fake fake fake Very bad channel no value for humanity in india always stand with poltic party,  never tried to understand what people in india needs,  no moral from channel cow dung channel bad fake channel bad fake channel bad fake channel fake bad channel fake bad channel fake bad channel worst worst worst"
RepublicTV,Worst and fake ever,1,This is the worst and fake channel I have ever seen in my life. You guys are focusing on spreading only fake news. That's why your rating came down. This is a kinda warning from public Moral: Think twice before you spread fake news about digital state(kerala) in India.
RepublicTV,Worst channel,1,"Worst channel ever scene, Kerala one of the best State in India republic tv trying to defame our beloved state by making false news, I dont know why they making all these, sometime as a Keralitie I used to wonder when I see some news from Republic tv, about kerala, dear Arnab please come to kerala and feel the peacefull life people of kerala having, please don't spread ultra lie about our god's own country, rating option should have'0' option also please"
RepublicTV,Very Bad attitude from channel,1,"Its very bad to make Kerala as bad state when its the No.1 state in India. Aurnub goswamy must be more polite and logical when he write things. +Ignore below 400 words are must to review+ To begin with, the biggest issue with Republic is that it began the channel using a scoop that was ethically not its. Though it tactfully will bring in the David vs Goliath analogy, it is just a stunt. The other issue with Republic is chaos over discussion. The classic Arnab style of debate sometimes for its biggest fans also a big pain to ears. Moreover, now Arnab is also going little overboard. Regardless of his personal views against Pakistan establishment, name calling the whole country is not befitting in any sense. And then asking the Pakistani representatives to agree and hear his views is outright over expectations."
RepublicTV,Really bad new content,1,Providing false information about a state like kerala for the interest of some political parties.This not the way for how a media should be.The way the channel is performing for the rss is not acceptable and the figures shows that kerala is the number one state in india in many aspect.You should consider the facts before giving a report an a peaceful state like kerala.
RepublicTV,Worst channel,1,"News can be views, but not just lies. Lies do not become truth by telling it loudly.This is what Arnab and other anchors try here. A channel need to reflect the sentiments and issues of the people. Here it is just the mouth piece of the ruling party. The biggest danger is that this channel do not many states in India as part of this country. A threat to India's federalism!The channel must accept and correct their mistakes."
RepublicTV,Worst channel,1,Biased and unethical channel primarily focuses on TRP rather than trivial issues that affect common man. Biased discussions for BJP without giving much room for diversified opinions. Unprofessional hosts and tabloidnatured choice of topics. Biased and unethical channel primarily focuses on TRP rather than trivial issues that affect common man. Biased discussions for BJP without giving much room for diversified opinions. Unprofessional hosts and tabloidnatured choice of topics.
RepublicTV,TRUTH ABOUT REPUBLIC,1,"Worst channel ever scene, Kerala one of the best State in India republic tv trying to defame our beloved state by making false news, I dont know why they making all these, sometime as a Keralitie I used to wonder when I see some news from Republic tv, about kerala, dear Arnab please come to kerala and feel the peacefull life people of kerala having, please don't spread ultra lie about our god's own country"
RepublicTV,Best news channel,4,"I love this channel because this channel never shows about anti India. And I love Arunab's anchoring because he has lots of knowledge and his aggressive anchoring is very effective to the indian people. This channel never shows silly things like others channels do. This channel is best of best news channel ever had India. This channel has talented jurnalist and anchors like Rajdeep Sardesi, sudeep chowdri and many more."
RepublicTV,Best English News Channel,3,"Hello friends today I am sharing my personal views on republic tv. the Republic tv is dream of Arnab Goswami sir. I daily watch republic tv. the Republic TV broadcast real and authentic news. the Republic tv is best english news channel. The chief editor of Republic TV Mr. Arnab Goswami is best news anchor. the best dialogue of Arnab Goswami is ""The Nation Wants to Know"". the Republic TV is best initiative by Arnab Goswami. the Republic TV is free to air channel which is best thing. anyone can watch the channel. the Republic TV also launch the website, which is very useful the online viewers. The Show Broadcast on Republic TV are best show. the Anupam Kher's Peoples, R. Access, PATRIOT, The Nation Wants to Know and the Sunday Debate with Arnab Goswami is very effective programs."
RepublicTV,A newly launched channel which covers every news,5,"This is a good news channel which is stared approximately two moths ago. Arnab Goswami the famous anchor of times now started this channel with the help of few others and he is the EDITOR IN CHIEF of this news channel. Republic tv is one of the news channel which telecasts the true news . In case of various scams, riots, unsolved murder case  they do sting operation and brings the reality in front of every viewer. When other channels suppressed the news they bring it in front of the viewers. So, if you watch Republic Tv you be up to date about every news of the nation not only the nation they also cover various international news . The Arnab Goswami debates which is telecast at 9 o'clock every evening is one of the greatest hit of this channel. The anchor and reporter like SAKAL, RITWIK, RHYTHM they are doing an excellent work. Watch republic to keep updated."
RepublicTV,Arnab TV!,4,"I have been following this channel from 15-20 days. Unlike other channels, Republic TV is less focusing and airing trivial matters. That's the biggest positive sign I particularly noticed. Generally northern media don't air south Indian matters a lot unless It's a big sensation. But this channel covers a good range of news across length and breadth of the nation. Recent drug bust in Hyderabad is aired on very first day itself. while other channels are focusing on trivialities. Hosts are very much expressive and intrepid in expressing their views and grilling the politicians on various matters. This is a positive sign of clean Journalism. As usual  Mr. Arnab Gowswami mark is clearly visible in the channel. His faceoff's are always worth watching. The glitch that I felt to be fixed is debate organizing and selection of guests. I would definitely recommend Republic TV!"
RepublicTV,"Republic TV, media company",4,"Republic TV was stared by Arnab Goswami after his fallout with his previous channel, even though he had a good TRP. I do randomly watch this channel for news. The channel has has good professional hosts and anchors covering the latest news which are on other channels too. The channel has young reporters for ground reporting which is good in terms of the energy which youngsters have. I do watch the debate program of Arnab which comes at 9 pm daily, and yes again he is doing the same thing on the debates which is he speaks too much as compared to the participants. He is famous for this stunt on TV. Good channel to watch, though these days all news channels cover same news at the same time(mostly)."
RepublicTV,Arnab exposes....,5,"Evertime A man named Arnab Goswami starts his debate at 9 and carryies it on till. Phenomenal work being done by a man, raising some issues which remains always untouched by so called media. A true channel, no propaganda to show but always having sympathy for BJP. Aranbs debate is the best place, where he shuts the mouth of fools of Political Party down, humiliate them unlike other propaganda channels where they are always busy in buttering politician. The Only thing Republic can do is that they may be more hard to Bjp because its seen they are soft to them"
RepublicTV,Clean Journalism,5,A true national news channel. It is not just a channel but a movement I believe. I trust in the words of my idol Arnab Goswami. He is a true nationalist and truly knows how to address the hypocrisy of whimsical politicians. I know the level of pressure and effort this channel it putting to overcome the threats and competition from other channels and politicians. I am with Arnab coz the game has just begun.
RepublicTV,Arnab the great,4,"Arnab is too good a journalist. I have lot of respect and love for him. There are many many plus points for him. But I like to bring in some of his negative points, whether he likes it or not. I am a well wisher of his channel. That is the reason I decided to spend some time on this. I feel sad when some of my learned friends tell me that they have stopped seeing the channel. Main problem is that the debates become a fish market and really difficult to stick on to the noise polluted debates. Arnab gets too much excited very often and it is highly unbecoming of a journalist.  Most of the time he fails to moderate the debate though this is his prime responsibility. Probably something has got into his head and he feels he is unsurmountable. I like the Republic TV to prosper and as such, I request you all to bring in good changes. .Col. Pratap(retd)"
RepublicTV,For the Public,5,It is a recently lunched channel in india.by a famous anchor arnab goswami.with his struggles.A only english news channel which contains more  debates liked by the people.this channel makes indian army proud.it tells social and political crisis faced by indian people and injustice faced by innocent people.
RepublicTV,Logical and statistical facts,4,Republic tv is the english news channel . The best part is it is free channel broadcasting in DTH and cable tv.the best shows  that are running in republic tv are 1.In this I think the best thing is there will be debates that are participated with arnab goswami . In this we can learn a lot of things. We can improve our general knowledge By watching this we can improve our communication skills One could definately learn the confidence and self belief that arnab exists . We can watch this channel in the hotstar and also jio tv
RepublicTV,"Arnab Goswami , King of Debating ,Man with mission",5,"Republic channel aired by Arnab Goswami, is the best channel of the day. The channel got highest TRP in the past few days. The channel is most viewed due to Arnab Goswamis free and fair views which are oriented towards the love for his country. He has the guts to take on any person be it businessman, politician, terrorist, diplomats or even fellow journalist. He dares to condemn whatever he feels is wrong.His love for India is felt in his debates where he pinches anyone that he finds to be anti Indian. The popularity of Republic Channel can be analysed by the fact that the 9:00pm slot is never missed by us. There are two debates where we see Arnab as a real hero and a patriot . He takes on very sensitive topics without a fear of anyone, such guts were never seen in the past. Salute to the brave journalist who is always saluting the Indian Army and his country."
RepublicTV,The Independent & Fearless Media of the Nation,5,"The Nation always wanted to welcome an unbiased, fearless journalistic team that will fight for common citizens of the country, that's Republic World Tv. An Indian born media network that will from hence forth compete the world media. But, what even more significant is the way team Republic lead by Arnab Goswami( the 9pm debater - fearless journalist) shock the nation by breaking an investigative story on Bihar scam or corruption, the link between a mafia/murderer who was continuing to operate the state politics by dictating over the sp chief Lalu Prasad Yadav( ex-chief minister of Bihar) . I wish team Republic all the best."
RepublicTV,Lantch A New TV News Channel.,3,"Hello friends this is Avtar Singh I want to share a review of Republic TV is an English language channel and current affairs Television channel based in Mumbai and Bengaluru, India. The independent  news channel went live on 6 may 2017 at 10 A.M. Available Satellite Airtel Digital Tv. Channel 376 Tata Sky. Channel 616 Dish Tv. Channel 771 Siti Cable. Channel 416"
RepublicTV,Arnab is Back ,4,Much awaited National news channel by Aranb is launched I liked there first story on politician and mafia nexuses. Aranb is the best TV reporter who has guts to ask hard hitting question. This channel is pro India and Pro army channel which speaks for India and Indians. I liked see Major Gaurav arya soon in action in this channel. Need improvements in reporting news but i am sure they will improve in time and I hope they report different type of news then sticking on to only one news whole day. Republic TV will be successful for sure.
Times Now,Times Now,1,"The news direct was truly great in introductory days when Arnab had joined and he was really doing great work.  However, now as opposed to revealing actualities he him self have gotten to be ""JUDGE"".  He sets the plan and tone of civil argument, exceptionally despotic. The civil argument is utilized to battle and make a point instead of really demonstrating a few certainties.  In spite of the fact that called NEWSHOUR, it really needs NEWS and just claim, assertion. The board is overpopulated to the point that I think TIMES NOW can welcome now total upper and lower house for verbal confrontation.  If it's not too much trouble STOP this drama and return to NEWS which helped this channel prosper"
Times Now,A dedicated news channel called Times Now,5,"Times Now is a dedicated TV news channel  complying with relevant broadcasting and Journalistic standards laid down by the National Broadcasting Standards Association.  Times Now is a leading Cable TV Channel  competing with other TV news channels such as India Today, CNN News 18 and News X.  Earlier,  Times Now was headed by leading journalist and news presenter Arnab Goswami. Now, the News channel is presented by people like Anand    Srinivasan, Navika and Rahul Shivshankar.  One has to appreciate the news presented by these honest and ethical News presenters who swear by honest and ethical journalistic standards in consonance with the high ethics followed by their parent news paper The Times of India.  Therefore, Times Now is the channel to look out for in the foreseeable future when one considers the wide variety of the credible quality of programmes,  the good range of programs and the honest, straightforward and even-minded anchors and hosts who host good and enjoyable shows on this premier tv news channel."
Times Now,Best channel in India,5,Times now is onebof the best channels in india. Especially NEWS HOUR with ARNAB GOWSWAMI its an exelent debet program among the all chennels. He questions the leaders behalf of the people in india and he rise the voice of us. time now channel never speaks behalf of one party or on person. Is always think for the people in india so it is getting more trp reting than other channels. Timesnow news anchors are presenting the news in defferent way which is attract to the audiance. Times now is first in presenting breaking news and accurate news.
Times Now,Only commercial news,1,"Times now is the only channel I have unsubscribed from my Reliance digital plan after watching it for an week. This news channel only broadcasts comnercial news. And the most talked about Journalist Arnab Goswami doesn't host the show in a proper manner, most of the times its just looks like a fight not a debate. And even the documentries filmed are not so informative. Any civil aspirant shouldn't watch this channel."
Times Now,Too much noise,1,"Times Now is one of the worst things to have happened to Indian journalism. The news channel has become quite popular for its daily show The NewsHour. The show basically comprises of the main anchor, Arnab Goswami, and around 7-10 other panelists on a debate. However, calling it a ""debate"" would be a disgrace to the term as it is essentially a one-sided argument where only the anchor speaks and screams his view. The views of others are hardly allowed to be expressed. This channel attempts to sensationalize all news and create a drama out of it - often straying away from the facts if need be. It's a mockery of journalism and hopefully is a trend that will fade away as quickly as it began."
Times Now,"I hate arnab goswami, I hate times now",1,"A news channel is defined by its news reporters and anchors. lately I have been watching debates and panel discussion on times now being hosted by Arnab and I was totally shocked with his attitude. he is not even worth listening. lemme be clear I m not being biased here but an anchor is supposed to maintain the peace, keep participants calm, listen to everyone, be unbiased and RESPECT EVERYONE. instead of trying to shout louder then participants and supporting and defending one party and hence directly involve into the discussion against other. I am really disappointed with times now and shocked how they even allow such person come on screen."
Times Now,FULL ON ENTERTAINMENT...,1,"This is the first time I could see an English News Channel filled with so much entertainment. The most funniest program being the News Hour Debate in which a mob will be their as invited personalities who will be labelled as for and against the topic to be discussed. But their fate is that they will never get a chance to give their views. Like a football match were the referee keep the ball in his hands and the players waiting to kick the ball and in the end the match gets finished and the referee starts a new match. Another funny thing to be noted that the same people who are used with the anchor's attitude will repeat their participation as if they might loose the tournament if they quit. The channel claims that it is the number.1 Indian News channel and repeats this information periodically like a school boy tells her mom "" mei first aaya first .""(jiyo mere laal)"
Times Now,Shut up now,2,"Times now is an English news channel which is quite popular. The Newshour which is kinda uniqe selling point of the TV channel is a debate show wherein issues of national and international importance  r debated. The debates are mostly moderated by  it's editor in chief Arnab Goswami. The debates or not neutral and usually Arnav reinforces one side and tramples the other.  also I have usually found him espousing leftist, communist and anti majority cause which should not be the case he should try to be absolutely neutral and impartial while facilitating a platform for healthy and meaningful debate. at times he calls too many people on debate and asks them to shut up and then goes on to hogg the entire airtime available. Ihope  my views reach newshour."
Times Now,True review for Times Now,4,Times Now is a decent channel for news in english.Its programme are okay sort of stuff. And off course you can abuse Arnab Goswamy but he has his own aura and he is the right guy for thick skinned Indian polticians. All though he some times behaves like school going ademend boy but its ok. Over all news is good and they are always able to make there presence felt in highly competetive indian news market. Watchable channel.
Times Now,Please need MUTE button for Arnab,2,"The news channel was pretty good in initial days when Arnab had joined & he was actually doing very good work. But now instead of reporting facts he him self have become ""JUDGE"". He sets the agenda & tone of debate, very autocratic. The debate is used to fight & make a point rather than actually proving some facts. Although called NEWSHOUR, it actually lacks NEWS and only allegation, allegation. The panel is so overpopulated that I think TIMES NOW can invite now complete upper & lower house for debate. Please STOP this sensationalism & get back to NEWS which helped this channel flourish."
Times Now,Times Now Is No Ruling Every Where In World,4,"Times Now is a 24-hour English news occupy in India. It is had and worked by The Times Group. Times Now was the first news direct in India to be pushed on flexible screens(Reliance Infocomm Network). It is in the blink of an eye one of the Global Partners with Twitter. News hour show by Arnab Gowswami is awesome yet once in a while he needs lead, upsets whilst someone else is talking. He doesn't have the basic respectfulness of keeping up an approachable way of talking and the need to talk in a normal voice as opposed to yelling. He just proceeds with interminably putting words in other's mouth.For this he has been standing up to criticism from all quarters. He is also Editor-in-leader of this news channel. If you are fascinated for survey Indian English news channel then endeavor to watch this channel."
Times Now,Good TV debates,4,"Times Now is a remarkable news channel. Well, it is better known for news hour- its daily news based program. We all know celebrity status of its news anchor Arnab Goswami.But, this happens to be a rare channel that has allowed debates on controversial subjects. One can safely presume that its news team really work hard on news content.By and large, it presents news in a logical manner.It also hosts some good shows- Foodie, travel show etc.Yes, it is a good channel."
Times Now,"This is not journalism , this is sensationalism.",2,I recntly wrote a review on times of india. Times now beloging to the same time group which manages tomes of india I have to say that the standerds if this channel is same as the newspaper. It is very low. Especially their editor in chief Arnab goswami is teribble. I have no idea how this channel became most watched news channel in india. All arnab does is screams. He does not care about others and he is always right. The debates are more of a screaming contenst. He does not even let the participants to complete their point. This channel tries to put in front of viewers even small issues like it is of national importance. Its jus silly and irritating. This channel is example of how low indian journalism has fallen. Durin nepal flood some reporter of this channel asked silly and insensitive question with victims. This channel does not deserve to be best it india india requires better journalism and news channel.
Times Now,Best rating channel,4,"All day full new  with the best news back to back news I will watch and spent all my day in watching news to know all information what is going share  market, all that I need and I watch this channel for increase my communication skills it is the best channel partner in the work that to provide every news instantly and live I would time to watch it and I love this channel friends and people please watch it  it's a best channel in the word for news to know everything where what's going on please watch it and rate this channel"
Times Now,Times Now problem never solved,3,"Times Now is one of the internationally well known news channel. It brings about numerous issues that is occurring in India. Every day there are debating on different issues, what I noticed in debate is that the issues of the problems are never solved all the debate are concluded without the full stop. Mr. A Goswami brings out good issues but he also try to obtain the solution to the problems. Debate should not be only for fighting but it should have fruitful end result."
Times Now,Thumbs down for ARNAB GOSWAMI,1,Arnab Goswami has forgotten he is a journalist. He just shouts only to panelist  those who is against to his opinions& used scape goat(Panelist) who are low in that particular episode. Selfish arnab differs his attitude towards favorites celebrities. On topics he only starts& the rest goes personal or out of track. Lastly arnab can fall such low level for TRPS to misguide we INDIANS was not expected from him.
Times Now,Worst and biased channel,1,"Worst and biased channel I have ever seen in my life, waste of time, hate full, hypocrisy, bloody bastartds would have taken money for sure,  never watch this channel,  and biased channel I have ever seen in my life, waste of time, hate full, hypocrisy, bloody bastartds would have taken money for sure,  never watch this channel,  and biased channel I have ever seen in my life, waste of time, hate full, hypocrisy, bloody bastartds would have taken money for sure,  never watch this channel, worst"
Times Now,Biased and politically motivated only,1,Time Now is very biased and goes with a pre determined agenda. The anchors make the decision about people they interview whether they are guilty or not before any courts convict them. They are heavily biased with one side of politics. It is very clear how Times Now strategises and wants to create their own villains out of good people.
Times Now,Aranab you are great,5,"There is no doubt that Arnab Goswami stand no. one in entire indian media . He is one of the best tv anchor, news presenter in india. Arnab class is different. He stands with truth. sometimes BJP supporters abuse him, sometimes AAP supporter abuse him and sometimes congress supporters abuse him. No doubt he is not with anyone but with the truth. Thanks Arnab keep this spirit up. I know muslims are targeting you because you take up with Zakir. sometimes hindus target you but I know you are with truth. be and stand with truth. Thanks for fair journalism."
Times Now,INDIAN,1,"No decency & just business, Especially, Arnab goswamy is Hindu extremist's agent, he is abusing the channel & the journalism. No decency & just business, Especially, Arnab goswamy is Hindu extremist's agent, he is abusing the channel & the journalism. No decency & just business, Especially, Arnab goswamy is Hindu extremist's agent, he is abusing the channel & the journalism. No decency & just business, Especially, Arnab goswamy is Hindu extremist's agent, he is abusing the channel & the journalism."
Times Now,Gobar  Goswami suckus!!!,1,"Anchor ""gobar"" goswami is nothing but the piece of SHI*T. he has no sense while speaking over the global TV platform, he tried to change indians thinking towards the Islam and it's teachings by blaming Dr. Zakir Naik. the real inflationary person in india is goswami himself. people please try to see the truth and take his every debate in the proactive way. ever since is he on the TV, he never had debate on poverty, development etc. topic. it's all about TRP propaganda of media to make such topic and earn money, but simultaneously this evil thing making our nations brotherhood in conflicts."
Times Now,Gobar Goswamy - Official Indian Journo-Criminal,1,"Gobar Goswamy is a traitor of India who wants to eliminate Muslims from India. He openly calls for killing, murder, violence against Muslims. This criminal should be hanged as his anti-indian work is open, but since he has 101% patronage of ruling Govt of India so he is free to do his criminal act. His continuous instigation for Riot across india is well appreciated by the Govt. Gobar Goswamy supports all terrorism done by Hindutva fanatics because he consider them to be patriotic acts. Gobar has brought new nadir to Journalism. He has put heads of all indian to shame. we are ashamed of having such criminal-journalist roaming free in india."
Times Now,Improper news ,1,"Is this a news channel this people dont show whats going around globe inteast they are intrested in who ran with whom, who slapped whom, did actors dog ate something I think all media news channel should grow . start showing good news. give knowledge to world"
Times Now,Arnab is BJP stooge,1,"One of the worst things to happen to india is arnab goswami.He thinks he is the most intelligent man and rest are fools. The truth is he is one of the dumpest journlist hanging around who has been thumplingly successful in changing the public perception. Courtesy him we have likes of Narinder modi and kejriwal ruling us. His news hour hardly questions  BJP and modi. He has big panels to show everbody in poor light, gets perturbed when panelists give opinion not in his favour. He needs to learn from  News anchors like Pranob roy. May God bless him with some wisdom."
Times Now,Debate or prejudiced monologue anchored by Arnab !,1,The so called News hour debate by Arnab Goswami should be aptly called as'monologue'  with one side of the panelist batting alongside him. Times now(read Arnab) may be thinking that the viewers don't understand as to how the so called'debate' is controlled through a'dictatorial'  and unilateral'shutting of the other side'  with constant interruptions while'his side of panelists' are allowed free run! I have been a great admirer of Arnab in his earlier avatar when the debate was really a debate and not a'monologue' and he also being to a certain extent being impartial in conducting the debate. It has become sickening now with viewers already knowing which position Arnab will take and which side of panelists he will align with with no chance for  other side to speak at all! I must say that instead the debates now being anchored by Rajdeep and Rahul are much more balanced and provides opportunity for both sides to express with anchor playing a far more balanced approach. I hope'Times Now' and'Arnab' see this comment and take this as a positive feedback and adopt a pragmatic and impartial conduct in all future debates with anchor not dominating all the way.
Times Now,Times Now - Indian News Channel,3,"Times Now is a 24-hour English news divert in India. It is possessed and worked by The Times Group. Times Now was the first news direct in India to be propelled on versatile screens(Reliance Infocomm Network). It is presently one of the Global Partners with Twitter. News hour show by Arnab Gowswami is great yet now and again he needs conduct, hinders whilst another person is talking. He doesn't have the fundamental civility of keeping up an affable manner of speaking and the need to talk in an ordinary voice instead of shouting. He just continues endlessly placing words in other's mouth.For this he has been confronting feedback from all quarters. He is additionally Editor-in-head of this news channel. On the off chance that you are intrigued for viewing Indian English news channel then attempt to watch this channel."
Times Now,Overkill on non-issues and sidelining of burning i,1,"The following post is being sent in Mumbai on Whatsapp. Unfortunately, its contents cannot be ignored. TV channels appear to be no longer concerned about burning issues dear to the common man. Instead TV channels appear to be on the side of the ""mighty"" by pandering to inconsequential, mundane issues(that do not concern the common man) and sadly these(mighty) are the most callous, selfish, corrupt, species on the planet! . Dear Arnab, Rajdeep, Rahul and other TV Anchors, The nation does not really want to know more about Sheena, Indrayani or anyone connected to the Mukherjea family. Sheena was killed and we all feel sorry for her. No one deserves to die this way and our blood boils but at the end of the day it's a private family matter and the law will deal with it appropriately. May be harsh to say but it's a fact that Sheena or those connected do not add any value to the nation. Even the jokes have exhausted. What  the nation wants to know is will onion and other commodity prices come down? Will corruption stop,  would everyone get good education, food, shelter, clean air n health care, will female infanticide stop,  will the caste system end,  would terrorism cease,  would the soldiers get OROP,  would the farmer suicides stop,  would we have cheap housing n transportation,  would we ever be free from religious fanaticism. The list is endless. What the nation does not want to know is how good you or your channels are in sensationalising the whole issue n how much are your TRP ratings. You have a powerful media that should be used for the betterment of the nation. Judiciary is powerful and very capable of dealing with heinous crimes and Sheena will get justice without your private investigations. Govt. is happy that the nation's attention is diverted as media is not talking about the real issues. FOCUS ON ISSUES THAT CONCERNS US. DON'T  TAKE US FOR A RIDE. Spread this like wild fire. Its so sad that our media sucks."
Times Now,A subjective news channel...,1,"TImes Now, when I hear this name I fill slapping that person.Time now is one of the worse news channel we ever have in India. Tough, Indian media has many time ashamed us in other countries for there dedication to journalism leaving humanity so far behind, TImes now wins the race. I personally really don't like Arnab's show franckly speacking, It is the show where people are called to speak and Arnab don't allow them to speak, sounds funny ha.! but its reality. The only clip I have seen Arnab hasn't question was his show with MNS president Raj Thakrey. I really watched that clip many times, you should watch Arnab's face in that clip. Apart from that, if we talk about journalism or news broadcast, TImes now become subjective to a news topic and they try to implement their conclusion without understanding what the reality behind it. Lets take latest topic of Jaslin-Sarbjit eve tease case, where s Delhi girl filled case against Sarbjit for eve tease, with other media channels Times now also at first instance noted Sarbjit as pervert. But, when after getting bail and providing eye witnesse for the case TImes Now still noting him as a culprit and a fool journalist of Times Now keep provoking Sarbjit to shout at her so their false allegations can be prooved. I am not sure who is true between Jaslin and Sarbjit, but for a news channel, a work is done when they serve news to us, they should not become judgmental to any news and find conclusions."
Times Now,Immature and Worst News Channel,1,"Please have this unprofessional channel banned. I was totally irritated by the coverage it gave to Jasleen Kaur's False eve teasing case in Delhi. How can a journalist humiliate an innocent person Sarvjeet Singh in front of the camera. These people have no right to pass the judgement and their broadcasting rights should be taken away. The immature lady journalist should apologize, who tried to harass and even sexually abused Sarvjeet Singh by touching him physically in front of the camera. I request everybody including ladies to support Sarvjeet Singh. tomorrow our own brothers and sisters could be a victim of such false case Arnab, Please study journalism.There are correspondence courses available in IGNOU. Communication is not the only skill required in Journalism. Satyamev Jayathe."
Times Now,Jasleen kaur case,1,"Mr Aranab you looks like you never cleared your jouranalism exam at your own . This is bxxxshxx channel with political background.making no real news .just faking the news, giving its own jidgement. We have campaign in my area to ban your channel from our side .its a putting very wrong message to all over india ."
Times Now,Worst new channel with own judgement,1,They feel that they are above the supreme court. In case of jasleen Kaur case I was shock to see the repoter trying to make the accused sarabjeet angry. And try to humiliate him in camera.they use media for incorrect means and such cheap channels should be banned. Please do not spoil somebody's life for your cheap publicity
Times Now,SUPER LOW LEVEL of JOURNALISM in Tilak Nagar Case,1,"I would like to comment for the below mentioned video link of Times Now coverage which is about latest controversy between a young guy and a girl from Tilak Nagar, New Delhi. https://facebook.com/video.php?v=968980906485599 In this Video Times Now Reporter Tries to convince the guy to accept that he harassed the girl. They Call him ""Pervert"" in Report in Channel. The Reporter is not ready to listen atall and force her opinion on the the guy. They have no proof or evidence of wrong doing by the Guy and they behaved as if they are the Judge. I have NEVER SEEN SUCH LOW LEVEL of JOURNALISM before. I was a big fan of Times Now before watching this video. But not I totally don't believe in them. The journalist looks so biased and it looks like she is either related or favor the girls without knowing any proof or just supporting the girl because the reporter is also a girl. May be to get better TRP they get to such levels."
Times Now,News begins here!,5,"I watch this news channel everyday and in each and every news will be updated very nicely! In this channel I like frankly speaking show by arnab goswami who is the CEO of times now! And also I like shows like News hour, prime pulse, live reports etc., on this channel! And they give 24/7 news updates and in the times of like Nepal earthquake every small bit of a thing that happening was being reported by them! And also recently they reported Dr. APJ abdul kalam's shocking news in detail! And they showed his speech and a bit of him talking in frankly speaking with arnab which I had not seen when kalam ji was alive. Of course as I said I have not missed any news on times now but I had missed one worth watching programme!and I don't know why? I recommend this channel for everyone to watch!"
Times Now,Good English News Channel...,3,Times Now is one of the leading English news channel of India.It was founded in the year 2006 and its Headquater is located in Mumbai. Arnab Goswami is the Editor-in-chief of this news channel.I used to watching this news channel since last 2 years.The best thing about this news channel is'THEE NEWS HOUR' at 9-00 P.M which is hosted by Arnab Goswami.He can raise the all the current activities of the country and World. Apart from this'NEWS NOW AT 12.00 NOON' is also one of the popular program of this channel.Times now had already won News channel of the year.If you are interested for watching English news then try to watch this channel.
Times Now,Times now is the worst channel and very negative.,1,Times now is the worst channel in the news network.  Very negative. Arnab Goswami should keep his mouth shut. The news readers are noisy and arrogant. The channel should  focus more on the positives that are happening rather than on the negatives. The only sound that one hears from the channel is noise whereas the other channels are peaceful and have better content. I don't watch the channel for more than a couple of minutes.
Times Now,NEWS HOUR HAS BECOME ABUSE HOUR,1,Times Now has Become Lousy Channel and Arnab is the worst Anchor among the all Anchors. In his News Hour program subject is not debated. He starts with one sided argument and starts igniting the emotions among participants instead of Anchoring. If he thinks he has all the knowledge of the world in all the subjects he should grow beyond TV Anchoring. We as Views get frustrated with one sided point of View of AG that we have stopped viewing this lousy channel. If Times Now has to grow Arnab shoud Go.
Times Now,Informative Channel,4,"Times now is a popular channel on TV.I like its range of shows and the issues they bring up. They are very good at news reporting too. They pick up many issue that other new channels choose to ignore.They have a good range of presenters and reports who do everything to keep it going good. News hour show by Arnab Gowswami is good but at times he lacks manners, interrupts whilst someone else is speaking. He doesn't have the basic courtesy of maintaining a polite tone of voice and the need to speak in a normal voice as opposed to screaming. He just goes on and on putting words in other's mouth.For this he has been facing criticism from all quarters. It covers news on various issues well and the quality of content is good. Overall a good channel to watch."
Times Now,Times Now - The nation wants to know!,3,"Times Now is the leading English news channel in India and is watched by most of the people who like to hear their news in English. It is on for 24 hours a day so that is a good thing. I like its range of shows and the issues they bring up. They are very good at news reporting too. They pick up many issue that other new channels choose to ignore. Arnab Gowswami, being a well respected and famous journalist does his job well. They also have a good range of presenters and reports who do everything to keep it going good. But I do not like the way he runs his talk show, he just keep mumbling stuff and does not lets other speak and he himself doesn't makes much sense most of the times. He just goes on and on putting words in other's mouth. For this he has also been at the receiving end of many jokes and parodies! Verdict: Watch it if you like your news in English and sensationalized!"
Times Now,Times now with arnab goswami,5,We dont get papers at home so tv is the only source of news for us. Generally my father in law watches aaj tak since he doesn't understands English. But my husband loves to watch times now. It gives perfect and accurate news within minutes. His favorite is news now and frankly speaking with Arnab Goswami. Generally he is very fond of debates on political issue and so every night its fixed that from 9 to 11 he will do nothing but watch this debate. This show is really awesome as Arnab is very straight forward and to the point and doesn't leaves anyone no matter who that be. It brings out the truth behind every story. Times now is one of the best English news channel till now according to me and my husband.
Times Now,India is Shamed of Times Now. Get Lost Arnab!,1,"Times now is a perfect example of cheap journalism. Their TRP have fallen down massively. To create sensation, they actually started feeling that India really wants to know from them. Fact is India wants you to go. Do you really feel that team India is shamed in Sydney? Team India has played its best cricket world cup ever. It was a tough day and a bad luck, so shut up Arnab and team."
Times Now,Arogant news channel,1,"Take a stroll through international news media channels - CNN, BBC, Fox News. you won't find any of them constantly thumping their chests about being Number 1, Being The Best, Being Ahead of Everybody Else, Always The First To Report a Story. and so on and on and on. It's unbearable. This so-called ""news channel"" does not report news - it shoves its opinion down your throat - take it or leave it. It takes the cheapest shots. It has no ethics, no principles and no manners. Its reportage is unbelievably biased, twisted and - quite often - a pack of outright lies. And if a news item is not sensational enough, or juicy enough or sleazy enough, they don't report it. The channel represents a blot on the name of debate, intellectual discourse and analytical journalism. Mr Arnab Goswami's version of ""debate"" is that: If you disagree with me, I will release a pack of minions to shout you down. In fact, an old-fashioned journalist from the print era describes the News Hour as Arnab-in-a-Box screaming at nine other screamers in respective boxes. You can't call this a ""debate"" by any stretch of imagination! This probably the only channel that runs its own promos as ""editorial content"" - yes! During the ad break, you'll get a counter that states back in so many minutes and so many seconds. When the counter reaches 0:00 - that's when the loud Times Now promos begin. It's cheap, it's disgusting and it isn't journalism! In the final analysis, Times Now is not about news - it's about boorishness, arrogance, chest-thumping, misbehaviour, embellishment, sensationalism, opinionated one-sided diktats and a completely warped view of journalism."
Times Now,Arnab is a joke on our democracy,1,"I used to really like watching The News Hour as I thought the anchor Arnab is one journo who actually has some concern for the nation and that his anger represents the people's anger in general. However, later I started to notice things. Too much focus on TRP! During the break, they keep showing statistics, about how Times Now had a competitive advantage over other channels. Shows they only care about ratings and telling all their secrets to the viewers! Also I noticed that Arnab actually goes too far sometimes. He finds it difficult not to take sides. I wish he took more of a neutral stance as an anchor. Because he gives loads of time (to speak) and barely interrupts the side he agrees with, but gives limited time to the other side, and keeps interrupting, insulting and shaming them. Seems like he is trying to force his opinion on us. Also he doesn't seem to respect ANYONE but himself. They showed a phone interview with Tarun Gogoi and Arnab once. In that he's literally shouting at Gogoi, ""You should be ashamed of yourself."" Does he know what a senior person he's talking to? Yes, that person did something wrong, I agree. But how can a random media person talk to a minister like that? Is he media or Indian judiciary? Also when Meenakshi Lekhi vented her frustration at him by saying ""You take money."" he looks at her and says ""Never ever make an accusation to an honest journalist."" Which law says I can't make an accusations to self proclaimed honest journalists like him? And even if she's accusing who is HE to decide whether he's guilty? Is he a judge or a journalist? His job is just to report news. He'd better just stick to that. Again, when someone said that to him, he said ""No, don't teach me my job as a journalist. I didn't become a journalist with your permission."" So even these ministers did not become ministers with Arnab's permission. Who the hell is he to teach them their jobs as ministers? He even told a Telengana minister ""Talk to me with respect."" Now that is just too much! First you give respect, only then you'll get it. By imposing that his opinion is the right one he has ruined the people's ability to think for themselves. By thrusting his own opinion on the people and terrorizing the nation, he has managed to control their minds and hence control the country. Which is why I say he's a joke on our democracy. And yeah. ""The nation wants to know"" To that I got to say that the nation wants to know what HE wants the nation to know."
Times Now,NUISANCE ON TIMES NOW,1,"I was also a regular viewer of times now but I observed very closely that this channel is not a creative channel but an annoying channel or nuisance channel or we can call it in simple words a khichari channel where the the viewers can not understand what is going on?On this channel no proper time is given to the speakers and most of the speakers particularly politicians do not have the sense to talk.They never show any patience in listening others 'views. I would like to suggest them They must watch HARD TALK on BBC WORLD and CROSS TALK on RT Channel of Russia.How much patience is being shown on these channels, No comparison at all particularly Arnav Goswami must learn lesson from these foreign channels how to behave with the guests .He must not talk like chatterbox every time and not try to become oversmart.He must not try to become over intelligent. I have observed him most shallow as well as fukra anchor, host as well as editors in the whole world.He must learn a lot from bbc world, RT, SKY NEWS channel, CNN and FOX news channel.He must try to invite limited people not the crowd in his programme, must be given due time to express their ideas, not allow to intervene the speaker in his due time.One time only one speaker only.More and more senior journalists should be invited to the programme because they show some sense and patience in their talking except so called shallow politicians.Moreover these journalists most of the time give their neutral expressions."
Times Now,Kick out Arnav,1,He is bullshit.Never give chance anyone to speak up.always he speaks bullshits to become famous.but reality is he never give chance to anyone to speak in front of him. Improve yourself and don't shout always.I don't know what he thinks about himself.Sometimes he is good but mostly he is just bullshit.
Times Now,Keep Children Away from Times Now's Newshour,1,"I know that many of you are intrigued, perhaps bewildered, by my request in the title of this review - but I mean it. The Newshour programme violates every aspect of etiquette, politeness, social grace and decorum. This programme is anchored by Mr. Arnab Goswami who knows absolutely nothing about manners, the avoidance of interruption whilst someone else is speaking, the basic courtesy of maintaining a polite tone of voice and the need to speak in a normal voice as opposed to raucous screaming. And all these can set very bad examples for impressionable children. You really don't want your children to get the feeling that such obnoxious behaviour is actually acceptable, do you? Yes, I am aware that many people do watch the Newshour - and they do so for the same voyeuristic reasons that lead people to watch the Jerry Springer Show, Big Brother(Bigg Boss in India) and other such low-grade rabble-rousing television shows. But should they be exposing their children to it? I should think not. Let's face it. Arnab Goswami is not going to change - at least not till his TRPs change and start heading in a rapidly downward direction. But you can change. Don't watch this pretentious nonsense - and if you must, do keep the children away from the Newshour."
Times Now,The difference is made here,5,"I think, in my view that the anchor is actually representing the emotions and the anger that the larger population have.But the larger population unfortunately are not in a position to express directly with the concerned persons. Arnab doing excellent job. Much appreciated. The problem with the Indian democracy is that the lacking of people participation in ruling the Nation. Most of us will think that it is just voting that makes us a participative citizens and responsible citizens which is factually not true because do you belive by voting once in 5 years we can call ourselves as responsible citizens. We are giving the mandate to who so ever to rule us for 5 years and we have one chance to give our opinion in this 5 years. How can we analyse the work by politician or political party in short term. There is noting we can do till the govt completes 5 years. So only our politicians will act so humbly and more people concerned during election periods and post which nobody will ever care us. We want some kind of mechanism to keep these politicians on track. So I absence  of one how can we be at least expect our politicians to act the way they are suppose to be. It is always depend upon how much involvement is there from us."
Times Now,One Of The Most Annoying Hosts In Indian Media,1,"I wish channels provide some level of communication skills training before telecasting. Mr. Arnab thinks he is beyond law and beyond morals. He is the judge and he is the lawyer. He constantly interrupts, talks over and tries to influence answers. Why does he not run his own one man interview show where he pretends to be interviewer and answers for interviewee. Its sad to have modern cable where 200 channels are thrown in and you get to take times now irrespective of if you like it or not. To top it up if someone visiting has to watch an interview we are stuck with seeing Arnab's face along with the person. I hope times now is sold or is taken over by some other company soon and we are spared of Arnab's ranting."
Times Now,Wrong doers should be ruled out from the ccountry,3,"I like your channel's news hour debate by Arnab Goswami. He usually takes the current affairs & makes the society  aware of it.  Even for Lokayuktha.this New hour helped to fetch more support for Anna Azare .But today I felt bad that you are not taking up the current issue.Nowadays there is increasing in the rate of Rapes & Murders. If press has the power to make the government to pass the bill, why u guys are not involving so much to pressure them to do so.Just think about the society too.other than increasing your channel ratings.After Delhi issue, now there is increase in the rate of victims. I think press has the power to wake the government, If you guys took a step forward then we, people will give u full support.Please take steps for enlighten future of our country, otherwise soon it will became a place not worth to live"
Times Now,News Anchor to remain only as an anchor,4,"Interesting watching news hour. Main problem is the anchor wants the panelists to tow his line of thinking or gets at them by asking embarrassing questions. 26.11.2013 during the second debate on the 5th anniversary of 26.11 the guests from Pakistan were treated shabbily by Arnab & Maroof. We should treat our guests with utmost courtesy, we may have many differences about what they say, but using harsh words like SHUT UP, rubbish, to be avoided, trying to corner them by regular interruptions by not giving them enough time to reply, does not go well and honestly I found most of the things they said other than Kasab's trial  were true. As an anchor Arnab needs to be neutral and give everyone fair amount of time to reply. Okay it's known most of them do not stop talking if given a chance or say irrelevant things, nothing wrong in such cases to intervene and take the debate forward."
Times Now,News Hour on Times now,5,"Of course, I do not think I can pass a comment, but whenever I get a chance, I do not miss primetime show on times now, during week-days. Particularly when Arnab, is interviewing (if I might say, squeezing the politicians) on various current issues that we as Indian are facing, it inspires me. Whether its coverage of Uttarakhand, or bringing up into public domain various scams, and exposing scams, the credit goes to Times now and all those brains working behind it. I am also amazed by the candid way Arnab conducts his talk shows. My sincere congratulations to Times now team."
Times Now,Arnab - fit for an auction job !,1,"This irritating anchor (who claims to be representing India), is so focussed on TRP that I feel pity.  How do these panelist stay around for so long.. I think they may be paid to come to the channel !  As soon as he feels that a valid argument is being given that may cool down things and spoil his 'hot spicy masala tu tu mai mai', he cuts the poor guest and smartly picks up a couple his objectionable terms/words to keep the heat alive. I am sure many panelist must have silenced him many times but the channel may have edited those clips away. I watched this a couple of times but honestly, I found it really funny and quite entertaining.. but guys, this is not worth calling news debate."
Times Now,NO STANDARD DEBATES...,2,"I just don't know, why they invite special people for the debate programs. This man ARNAB GOSWAMI, make a fight and never let others to talk. If somebody makes a point, he immediately intervenes and shouts over them and never allow others to complete their point. He lacks professionalism and ethics, which an anchor must require to host a debate or a discussion. For example, the current IPL spot fixing issue, where this man ARNAB GOSWAMI keeps on shouting and repeating the same points which he made earlier. He makes a scene as though he is the only person in India to get concerned about the issue. He over reacts like an actor, I think he should be reminded that he is still a news reporter and not an actor. His action surprises me to think, whether there is any award given for reporters for reactions before the camera. To the heights of comedy, this ARNAB GOSWAMI says, they are talking more about IPL SCANDAL because, they know how much love people do have over cricket..BUT HE NEEDS TO KNOW, THAT, WE KNOW HOW MUCH LOVE YOU HAVE OVER THE TRP RATINGS. I think there are many problems in the country to be discussed and sort out, where this channel is keep on giving news about IPL alone for the past one week. TIMES NOW news channel has still some reputation left over in the minds of the people. Don't loose that, by having ARNAB GOSWAMI in your sets......."
Times Now,Times Now itself Indulge into Moral Policing,1,"It was really really amusing and surprising to watch programme on your chanel regarding so called contravercial statements given by Mr Bhagwat and Mr Kailash Vijayvargiya. I was surprised when anchor started teaching moral lectures while pointing out Mr Bhagwat and Mr Vijayvargia. The context of the statements were cleverly kept hidden and hammering was continuously on terming or branding Mr Vijayvergia's remark as contraversial and sexy. I have failed to understood what was wrong in the statement in my view Lakshaman Rekha is nothing but the level of acceptance everybody enjoys crossing it by anybody is aught to attract adverse situation and effect. We in our own house also follow the certain rules and regulations which is nothing but Lakshman Rekha for all family members. So advising certain cautionaries does not accounts to moral policing. Laxman Rekha is very commonly used term I dont know which freedom and whose freedom Times Now want to define, for God sake dont try to disturb the social ethics ans value under the garb of freedom. Even western philosopher has also defined freedom in its best form with certain essential social restrictions. Without restrictions freedom tend to take a form of ""Vyabhichar"" Secondly who has given right to your chanel reporter to reach to conclusion at its own and shout for self proclaimed punishment, thus tarnishing the image of the indidual without giving him apportunity to put across his points DON'T YOU THINK YOU ARE ALSO DOING SAME WHICH YOU ARE CONDEMNING. You got know right to publically say this is right and that is wrong, So your chanel also got indulge into my freedom of thought. Please let me decide whether Mr Bhagwat and Mr Vijaywargia is right or wrong. So please dont jump to conclusions and spread hetred about the individual. Your chanel is harping on apology of Mr Vijaywargia on his  statement you want him to step down. Similarly we want apology from TMC on the act of their local leader but you never ask apology from congress on the act of his local leader Mr Bramha. Why such kind of bias reporting? Your chanel reporters and editors try to convert news chanel into entertainment chanel by adding spices, making it sensetional and jumping to the glaring conclusions. In this act Mr Arnab Goswami even forgets the age and position of panalist and goes unnecessarily agressive. Please let News channel be News channel only dont try to make it entertainment chanel Your chanel's achoring needs to be decent must revolve around the facts and not around self proclaimed conclusions."
Times Now,THE CHANNEL WITH A HEART,4,"The channel itself has a heart. most of the news channels are showing what they should show with out their own view. but watch this guy, ARNAV , he just give TIMES NOW a heart , a mind, and a mouth to express. The channel that has its own view.some may say it bias, but I must tell-its great channel which is also part of a REVOLUTIONARY INDIA."
Times Now,Times Now : III rate News Channel,1,"Firstly, this channel has immature anchors, and lead by the most immature lead anchor Arnab Goswami. a. Pro-RSS, b. Pro-Hindutva c. Pro-Brahmins d. Anti-Establishment(mainly anti-congress, anti-UPA) e. Anti-Dalit, Anti-Muslim and Anti-minority a. Sensationalizing tivial issues b. Take up issues pertaining to upper class/upper caste For instance, take the latest Madhavan Nair case, Nair is implicated by High Power Committee and High Level Team set up by GOI and PMO. Nair was punished based on the findings of the panel as they are highly experienced people to take a call on intricate issues of ISRO. TIMESNOW  openly dared govt. as if govt. is at wrong. Instead of nailing Nair for his misdeeds, Arnab Goswami is questioning the Govt. and even questioning the PMO. TIMES NOW repeatedly telecasted interviews of Nair showing dissent at the punishment given by govt. TIMESNOW also tried to bring in civil war within the country by sensationalizing Anna movement, which was backed by Hindu right wing openly. In panel discussions BJP is given priority, if there are 7 panel members, 3 will be BJP and one will be from congress, but now the trend is going down. In panel discussions Arnab behaves in way to confuse all participants. The questions he puts is mostly in-appropirate, there is cross talking and interruptions in the discussions. TIMESNOW proudly claims the news broke first on it's channel, I have browsed at many breaking news and found XNEWS is most responsive when it comes to quick coverage of breaking news. Arnab Gosami should be trained properly in behavior and also social obligation as he is only pro-brahmin and anti-dalit. News channels like TIMESNOW are dangerous to our nation which has mix of religions and lingual diversity. I hope Arnab reads class IV social studies subject,  National Integration."
Times Now,High Time to Change ,2,"Congratulation for bringing out news in such a way that  culprits have no way to run for cover Having said that  don't you people realize that you  are keenly focusing on reports that's bringing a real bad image for India in front of the other countries. From the Bombay terrorist attack to the Kashmir Issue to the Common wealth Games . Are we not getting  real sick news from your  channel, Kashmir has lot of other stories to tell,  the way Govt Of India was able to win the hearts of kashmir people till these days, Whole world now feels Kashmir is not at all safe  Your reporting are making kashmiris  a different stream of people and making the world think Kashmir issues cant be handled by India, giving any countries a free hand to talk about it, Times now change now, give the public some good side of the picture too, CWG - We know from NDTV news that corruption is running in the management blood , Apart from some dirty toilets and broken bridge don't your reporters see any good thing where the world can see some thing nice abt this event.

Your channel is becoming an Anti India Channel, Try to bring out some good news among all these mess , Spread some pleasant warm news than becoming a sadist reporter lets join hands to  make India a better place to live .... Happy reporting"
Times Now,Smartest news channel,4,"Timess now is one the smartest news channel I have come across in india...it tries to give the best news across the world not only the news but the discussion they have on each n every topic is valid... The big fight is the best part of times now... As it is an English news channel..the pronunciation used, even the words used by the people presenting the news is really great...this is the only news  channel which gives knowledge or to be precise practical n correct knowledge about business, sports, n studies , no news channels have this..like ""aaj tak"" or ""India TV"" shows all nonsense n gossip things about each and every celebrities. So I would suggest u people that go n watch times now channel for correct and up to date news."
Times Now,Tabloid journalism!!!!!,2,"This message is for **Arnab Goswami, Editor-in-Chief, Times Now* Dear Arnab, You are such a cheesy sensationalist reporter! Mumbai is under siege People are dying A well planned terrorist attack is ongoing India, and Mumbai in particular, are in crisis and all you think about are repeatedly pointing out ""Time Now Exclusive"", ""You won't see this anywhere else Ladies and Gentleman but on Time Now"" and other such ridiculous nonsense which displays the depth of your journalistic integrity. Who the hell cares if it is an exclusive?  People are dying for gods sake!  This is probably the single most important piece of news you will cover in the next 5-10 years and there are a few more important things to worry about than trying to toot your own horn.  WAKE UP! Furthermore, in your desperate attempt to find some juicy bits of information, you have a tendency to ask such stupid and asinine questions completely taking away from the gravity of the situation. Please.take a chill pill.relax.and let the news happen and report that.instead of trying to appear to do serious journalism while really practicing tabloid journalism. You are clearly an intelligent man.but you probably do not belong in front of live camera or you need to re-think how you want to report!  Times Now has the potential for greatness in the long term - and the ball is in your hands to make sure that you take the channel there.  Don't try to score immature and short term wins that reflect poorly on you and on the channel that you have worked hard to bring to market."
Times Now,Good work! Keep it Up!,3,"When many Indian T.V. news channels are busy disguising non news items, gossip and superstitious filth as news, this one owned by Times of India is doing good work. Still I am not going to say it is a ray of hope, as it is still far behind from the likes of the B.B.C. But currently it is doing better than most. Arnab Goswami is one spectacular presenter on the channel and captures viewers attention not only by his quality of presentation but also his understanding of the matter he is discussing and the sincerity the profession demands. Unfortunately this is not the case with most of the news prsenters on Indian news channels particularly Aaaj Tak and Star News are almost always involved in some cheap gossip. Ironically the parent news paper The Times of India is not known for journalistic quality... I wonder how Times Now is maintaining good standards in news reporting and analysis. One particularly good feature is that the channel allocates time to events on international arena.. and doesn't behaves like othes who focuses only on India specific news. One can only hope that this one will not surrender to the popular public demand and will uphold good ethical standards in reporting and journalism ... something it is doing sucessfully till NOW."
Times Now,Great English News Channel,4,"News Channels are just like *Pan-Thelas *in India. These days everyday or another a new channel comes up. Regarding quality, it's better if we don't talk of that, as these people really don't understand this word! We all are familiar with India TV, Aaj Tak, Janmat etc.(never ending list) But there are few good news channels like, NDTV Hindi, NDTV English, Times Now. But what I like about Times Now is their selection of news and the way they deliver it. Times Now always focuses on SERIOUS, BIG and National or international issues rather than finding out who was the robber in your neighbourhood robbery and such Crap$! It's Editor Mr. Swaninathan, is one of the best in India.(If you will agree with me if you read his articles in Sunday TOI or watch his programmes on TImes Now.) There might be a delay of 5-10 minutes sometimes in reporting some news, but then Times Now(as far I know) has not telecasted wrong information and then apologize for the same. Also, I was greattly impressed by their recent campaigns like'India Poised' and'Lead India' which is still going on. It's really a great platform for Indian Citizens to raise their voice. But unfortunately I wasn't able to participate as I was not eligible for as per their age rules. So overall I would like to say, Having such responsible 3-4 channls is a must!"
Times Now,Times NOW,2,"I have always held the Times Of India in the highest esteem as a very credible newspaper. I am a regular viewer of Times NOW due to it being part of the TOI group I presume. However yesterday on the 2nd of October I was really surprised to see blatant misquoting on such a channel. It was with regard to the interview of Greg Chappell. On being asked whether he would be friendly with Saurav ganguly again, he stated "" I may never see him again"" which in the context very clearly meant that he could not answer the question of being friends simply because he was not sure if he would ever be able to see Ganguly again. However the channel made it hedline news stating that "" Chappell says he will never see Ganguly again' Later this was toned down to Chappell says he may never see Ganguly again, but the playing to the galleries by this otherwise so perfect channel was truly pathetic. Another incident yesterday was when the sports news guy mentioned that "" Uthappa was done in by a rank bad decision"" which was simply not the case as anyone who saw the match would agree with. No one was dismayed by the decision , not even Uthappa himself. Yet this uninformed person on Times NOW has the cheek to pass a totally biased and unqualified judgement on the leg before decision of Robin Uthappa. Take care Times NOW , now is the time to watch and edit your news properly if you want to retain your credibility. Dont act like a tabloid."
Times Now,It’s TIME(s) NOW for a change,3,"A man was sitting on the edge of his chair, watching TV. He was holding a glass in his hand and as he was watching he crushed it unable to withhold effect of the programme he was watching. No, he was not watching any thriller movie; he was watching a News channel. “Ever watched news like this before”. I was just describing a hoarding in Chennai, an advertisement for the yet another news channel – Times Now. One of my friends told me about this new news channel and that got me just a bit interested, especially because it was in affiliation with the Reuter (pronounced as Roi-ter) group.  Then I happened to see the hoarding I just described. So these two instances are good enough to provoke me to switch my TV on and get a feel of this one. I added this channel to my green button (smart list) on my Philips remote, which already holds a list of news channels like Headlines today, NDTV, NDTV Profit, Sun news, BBC and CNN. A bit of background: Reuter is one of the most famous agencies that sell news for broadcasters and newspapers all over the world. This creates interest in Times now, since it is a part of the Reuter group. But I am not really sure about its reach in India, but this news channel could be one of the ploys to get more information around in this country (just my intuition).  About the channel Though it aims to be different, I find that this is just another news channel. There are programmes for the entire category of news – Political, sports (off late I don’t find this different from the first one!), fashion, entertainment and so on; And of course, the regular news. I never felt anything like what the hoarding boasted, not even something close to that. I was watching one of the programmes called ‘Life’s like that’, which is some kind of a guest talk or easy chat programme. You find these kinds in all news channels. But here you have lot many guests and the seating arrangement is very different that the host has to turn here and there (and break her neck) to see who is speaking. That is just the difference you get.  A comparison with other channels If Aaj Tak says ‘tez news’, headlines today says ‘Sharp news’ and this one says ‘feel the news’. In the end it is all news. What matters is the way you present that news. NDTV has established itself and Headlines today is establishing still. When I go to NDTV, they just speak so fast that they try to make news even out of nothing. Headlines Today runs short of programmes that they repeating the same news over and over and I get tired hearing them. This new channel is devoid of both these and can be appreciated in this aspect. I started watching Headlines today because of smriti (a news reader) and stayed with NDTV when she shifted to NDTV! Now being more matured, I look only for news and I am getting tired of all the current news channels. The great Indian tamasa (NDTV) is not humorous anymore and the sound of saba karim commenting of cricket matches (Headlines today) irritates me. Times now is a new channel and somehow a new news channel always scores.  Final verdict The channel is new and brings fresh feeling. I am recommending this channel simply because of the reliability of its news source. As far as the channel is concerned, I feel it has a long way to go. It is trying to be different. Whether that difference will make new sense or nuisance, is to be seen. It is just a new channel, so let us give it some more time to evolve. (And me some space in the comments section to post any interesting programmes that I find in this channel in the future)."
Times Now,Biased News Channel,1,"This News Channel is one of the Godi Media of India run by the ruling party BJP. The anchors are scared to ask questions to the ruling party, instead asking questions to the Political parties who are not involved in the decision making. What stupidity of running a news channel. I would recommend all those people who are seeing this channel in USA or other foreign countries to unsubscribe this channel. If you love India you will do it, or else face the consequences in the future. God Bless India. Jaihind."
Times Now,Terrible debates,1,"Why do they get people on the panel for discussion and do not allow anyone to complete their talk? Further, they allow all the participants to speak at the same time thus, creating the cacophony. It is quite painful to watch this debate everyday and every time!!!"
Times Now,Have unbaised reporters,3,Mr Athar on your channel is totally anti right and Anti Bjp he makes it clear by his facial expressions while the other participants are making their points and even ends up defending people from Congress and one community when arguments are raised from other participants or even another editor Mr madhav . This kind of open one sided Ness shud be stopped or it will increase to a level when one day your channel will loose its reputation.
Times Now,Review for times now,1,Worst channel in indian history and talk like boss show as if they are voice of people and support worst party bjp won 104 seats in karnataka and rest of india by cheating and supporting for horse trading.this is times now.and shouting at non bjp leaders as they are correct getting tensed for watching the channel the channel should be banned
Times Now,Raising people voice,5,It is one of the best choice in India to raise the voice of people. the famous is Arnab Goswami who raise people voice in media. News is everywhere but what makes the difference is how they are interacting with the people and Times of India is the best to get the problems of people out through the media National questions to any of the politicians without any fear. And Times Now is one of the biggest channel in India. And this channel has a network with different categories like Bennett University and so many other channels and apps etc. This is one of the best channels in India where we can get the original information Unlike the other channels who are just like puppies to political leaders and political parties finally it is the best channel
Times Now,Best channel Times Now,5,"Im going to tell about Times Now channel. Times Now is a dedicated TV news channel complying with relevant boardcasting and journalistic standards laid down by the National boardcasting standards association. Times Now is a leading cable Tv channel competing with other tv news channels such as India Today, CNN News 18 and News X. Earlier, Times Now was headed by leading journalist and news presenter Arnab Goswami. Now, the news channel is presented by people like Anand Srinivasan, Navika and Rahul Shivasankar. One has to appreciate the news presented by these honest and ethical news presenters who Swear by honest and ethical journalistic standards in consonance with high ethics followed by their parent news paper The Times of India."
Times Now,Very informative,5,Love this news channel! . And gives us a lot of good information very much awesome and the news readers they have nailed it wonderful and it is people's channel and it hears the people's voice and helps everyone and more over its very straight forward that it can question anyone who is bad and it is the beauty of the news channels loved it
Times Now,Times now is a biased channel,2,"Per the viewing of the number programs and debates on the channel, it is clearly visible that this channel is biased channel and de-supports all other parties. The panels on the channel do not allow the parties to talk and share their views, instead they shout on the channels and watching this channel makes people more aggressive instead of assertive language. The other channels are more of providing news rather than only debates on Times Now which is making use of the public's(men) psychology of aggressive behavior which most of the men are suppressed and would like to express through the channel."
Times Now,"After Arnab gone, nothing is the same!",2,I was almost a regular watcher of Times Now while Arnab Goswami was at the helm. His Newshour show where he was the boss and spared none in his debate show. But ever since he is gone my interest in this channel were faded away and right now I srldom watch this channel. None of it's anchors have the charisma of Arnab Goswami and cannot run a prime time show of their own. Their range of programs were also quite average nowadays and their quality is suffereing due to a lack of good journalists. My advice to them will be bring Arnab back or perish!
Times Now,Worst worst paid English News channel of India,2,"It is a worst paid news channel. Ir is quite evident you dont have to be very informative about politocs or functioning of media. You can sew that they have prw determined mind set before  debating  or conducting any show.  Which is very bad for p because media olhas a very strong role in democracy. And they have to function accordingly. But unfortunately times now isn't doing justice to that. Specially arnab goswami, who only  shout and not listening to other people. Dont respect the opinion of other whoch is very unfortunate."
Times Now,They changed the way news done in India,5,"Ever since I enrolled myself to journalism college for higher studies and got deeper into understanding the subject beyond newspaper headlines it always fascinated me for many reasons. I feel when you become a journalist in the field of either print or audio visual media it give you the independence to put out your opinion with responsibility that has the power to either make or break an affair in the place or country you belong. Although I am a sole believer of honest journalism and used to believe most of the Indian Media is indebted to the larger interest of the nation but I was wrong when I actually started to work for as a part of this industry. I have no objective to let down any of the media organizations run in this country but it always make me unhappy when I see most the the media are in a mess. It was even serious at the time of 2004 to 2008 when there was sansanati news stories at aajtak projecting semi entertainment alike crime and so made horror packages for the sake of viewer's rating point often known as TRP. The revolution of news which it actually mean to be has been coined by TimesNow led by the maker himself called Arnab Goswami. Ever since I have become a great admirer of him. If you're a news enthusiasts so you must have heard and seen The NewsHour with arnab goswami for straight 2 hours times if not more. There is also another popular show hosted by the leader itself was frankly speaking with arnab goswami, where public figures across nation as well as globe who make news headlines are interviewed upon by Arnab with tough questions. Apart from that the other news and reporting was done via hard hitting journalists team, and their commitment towards presenting unbiased news,Â  tough questions to public figures and politicians have always made them uncomfortable, this make them the most trust groups in news medium."
Times Now,NO 1 English news channel in india...,4,"Ever since I watched the newshour at 9pm I became the fan of this news channel.Never seen a journalist lke arnab goswami who ask more tuffer question than any other journlist in india.its a most watched news channel in india because of its brave and independent journalist, like arnab goswami, Anand, Tina sharma, navika etc.it focuses on the issue which was not highlighted by any other news channel like #VVIRACISAM"
Times Now,Winning the TRP last 8 years,5,Arnab the editor in chief goes in depth into issues. I consider it as a non biased channel. I just see this channel to learn English. It has helped me to improve a lot unlike Barkha or rajdeep sardesai it doesn't fall into any political parties. Times Now and Arnab are are raising voice against the Corruption all the time. for me no other news channel comes anywhere near the success rate of times now.
Times Now,Too much noise,3,"Times Now is one of the worst things to have happened to Indian journalism. The news channel has become quite popular for its daily show The NewsHour. The show basically comprises of the main anchor, Arnab Goswami, and around 7-10 other panelists on a debate. However, calling it a ""debate"" would be a disgrace to the term as it is essentially a one-sided argument where only the anchor speaks and screams his view. The views of others are hardly allowed to be expressed. This channel attempts to sensationalize all news and create a drama out of it - often straying away from the facts if need be. It's a mockery of journalism and hopefully is a trend that will fade away as quickly as it began"
Times Now,Proud Indian Channel,5,"Worshiped the composed work, the performing specialists. Valued the music, as well(""I'm an Apeman."") A smart satire. I roarTimes Now is a 24-hour English news redirect in India. It is had and worked by The Times Group. Times Now was the first news direct in India to be pushed on flexible screens(Reliance Infocomm Network). It is in the blink of an eye one of the Global Partners with Twitter. News hour show by Arnab Gowswami is awesome yet once in a while he needs direct, obstructs whilst someone else is talking. He doesn't have the crucial affability of keeping up a friendly way of talking and the need to talk in a standard voice rather than yelling. He just proceeds with unendingly setting words in other's mouth.For this he has been standing up to criticism from all quarters. He is moreover Editor-in-leader of this news channel. In case you are interested for survey Indian English news channel then endeavor to watch this channel.ed with chuckling no under twelve times, and I every so often do that. This and ""Better Call Saul"" are the TV indicates I have taped. In case Team Forte can deal with the imaginativeness, amazements, and craftsmanship, The Last Man on Earth, an altogether entertaining parody about insignificant intriguing of things- - discouragement - may live long and flourish. This show is totally historic! Not your regular sitcom people are used to. Urge to haters: take a full breath and value the comic dramatization and virtuoso of the show up. An extensive bit of the haters said; ""I just watched it for 5 minutes and expected to change the channel"". Will Forte is amazing! A champion amongst the most creative funnies of our time"
Times Now,The best entertaining English news channel,3,"I personally like this news channel.most of the time when I want to watch news, I switch to Times Now. I accept the fact that it is not a subtle news provider.but the way they package news is really interesting. So, at same time you do not get bored and get some latest news. Their debate programs are also really worth watching.they bring in lot of eminent personalities together and let us take their point of views.which definitely make us updated. Arnab is somewhat a loud character.but he makes sense most of the times. What I like about Arnab is that he is quite secular in his opinions. Times Now is very well connected to international news also.they have good tie ups with international news agencies. Their business news is also quite useful. Overall a nice channel to have it in your DTH package. But, yes they have too many commercials."
